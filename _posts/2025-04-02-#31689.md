## Notes

- Bitcoin Core uses the [nanobench](https://github.com/martinus/nanobench) library for a suite of ["microbenchmarks"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/src/bench) that measure the performance of individual components or functions in idealized conditions.

- [`Chainstate::ConnectBlock()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0a1e36effaa5aa27bc5f2c4955c1fa2eb2f0c8fa/src/validation.cpp#L2437-L2786) does double-duty: it is partly responsible for validating blocks being connected to the node's tip, and partly responsible for applying their effects to the node's view of the UTXO set (`CCoinsViewCache`).
    - One of the most "expensive" checks [performed by](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0a1e36effaa5aa27bc5f2c4955c1fa2eb2f0c8fa/src/validation.cpp#L2701) `ConnectBlock()` is [`CheckInputScripts`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0a1e36effaa5aa27bc5f2c4955c1fa2eb2f0c8fa/src/validation.cpp#L2144-L2253): which ensures that every input script of every transaction succeeds.

- In the course of [evaluating](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0a1e36effaa5aa27bc5f2c4955c1fa2eb2f0c8fa/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L406) scripts, signature checks are often required, sometimes explicitly with opcodes like `OP_CHECKSIG`, `OP_CHECKMULTISIG`, and sometimes implicitly with Bitcoin output types like [P2WPKH](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#p2wpkh) that have [implicit signature checks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0a1e36effaa5aa27bc5f2c4955c1fa2eb2f0c8fa/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L1893-L1900).
    - In pre-SegWit and SegWit version 0 outputs, signatures are generated and validated using [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) over the secp256k1 curve. [Taproot](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki) introduced the version 1 SegWit output type, which uses [Schnorr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature) signatures over the same curve. [BIP-0340](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki) describes the way signatures are generated and evaluated for taproot outputs.
        - One of the advantages of Schnorr signatures over ECDSA signatures is that they can be verified [in batches](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki#batch-verification). A simplified description of batch verification is that instead of needing to prove that signature $A$ is valid for input $X$, signature $B$ is valid for input $Y$, and that signature $C$ is valid for input $Z$, we can add up signatures $A$, $B$, and $C$, to produce signature $D$, and add inputs $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ to produce input $W$, and then only perform a single verification, that signature $D$ is valid for input $W$.

- Although in principle schnorr signatures can be validated in batches, Bitcoin Core today validates them individually just like ECDSA signatures. There is a PR open, [#29491](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29491), that implements Batch Validation in Bitcoin Core. The motivation for this PR is to establish a baseline for signature validation performance in Bitcoin Core today, which can then be used to validate and potentially quantify performance improvements of Batch validation.
    - [#31689](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31689) introduces three `ConnectBlock` benchmarks, one for a block where all inputs that are spent use ECDSA signatures, one where all inputs are Schnorr signatures, and one where some are Schnorr and some are ECDSA.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

2. Did you run the benchmarks? What did you observe?

3. What is `TestChain100Setup`? What does `100` mean? Why `100`?

4. The notes above suggest that `CheckInputScripts()` is "expensive". Is it? Why?

5. Some reviewers (and a code comment) observed that in their testing `ConnectBlockMixed` was the slowest of the three benchmarks. Is that possible?

6. Some reviewers disagreed about whether or not the 'mixed' case should be 50/50 schnorr/ecdsa, or if it should be some mixture of Schnorr and ECDSA that would be likely to appear in a block, what are the tradeoffs of each approach?

7. What is the purpose of the [first transaction that gets created](https://github.com/Eunovo/bitcoin/blob/7edaf8b64cb2d59ada22042fee62a417e52368b8/src/bench/connectblock.cpp#L37-L40) in `CreateTestBlock()`? Why couldn't this transaction be created in the [`for` loop](https://github.com/Eunovo/bitcoin/blob/7edaf8b64cb2d59ada22042fee62a417e52368b8/src/bench/connectblock.cpp#L47-L59) like all the other transactions?

8. `ConnectBlock` does [a](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0a1e36effaa5aa27bc5f2c4955c1fa2eb2f0c8fa/src/validation.cpp#L2653C10-L2684) [lot](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0a1e36effaa5aa27bc5f2c4955c1fa2eb2f0c8fa/src/validation.cpp#L2750) [more](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0a1e36effaa5aa27bc5f2c4955c1fa2eb2f0c8fa/src/validation.cpp#L2724-L2728) than just checking input scripts. Is this PR introducing a `ConnectBlock()` benchmark or a signature validation benchmark? Why use `ConnectBlock()` instead of benchmarking [`CheckECDSASignature()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0a1e36effaa5aa27bc5f2c4955c1fa2eb2f0c8fa/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L1647-L1670) and [`CheckSchnorrSignature()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0a1e36effaa5aa27bc5f2c4955c1fa2eb2f0c8fa/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L1672-L1698) directly?

9. Do you think the tests added here are sufficient in scope or are there other cases that should have been added in this PR? What additional benchmarks of `ConnectBlock()` would be good to have in a follow-up PR?
