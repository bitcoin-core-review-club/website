## Notes

- This PR is a followup to [#25218](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218) introducing helper class `BResult`, which we discussed in a [previous review club]((https://bitcoincore.reviews/25218)).

- In [#25721](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25721) `BResult` was renamed to `util::Result`, and the interface modified to resemble that of `std::optional`.

- The description of this latest PR [#25665](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665) comprehensively lists the introduced changes, as well as useful information on history and alternatives. In summary, the proposed functional changes compared to the initial `BResult` design are to:
  - allow a result to have both a value and an error message, instead of just one of both.
  - allow a result to store multiple errors and warnings, instead of just a single error.
  - allow multiple results to be chained, where a `util::Result` can be instantiated from another `util::Result` and take over its errors and warnings.

- This PR is quite heavy on generic programming and templating. Since `util::Result` is a helper class, we want it to be usable in a wide range of use cases, and can't make assumptions about the types of values it will hold.

- The `util::Result` class draws parallels with the Rust [`std::result Result`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/) type.

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. Which use cases previously not handled well by `util::Result` does this PR target? Why did `util::Result` need an upgrade to be compatible with `LoadChainState()` and `VerifyLoadedChainState()`?

1. [#25721](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25721) states `BResult` had a less familiar interface than the well-known `std::optional`. Is that a good enough reason to change it? What other reason(s) do you see for this change?

1. What is a `union`? Why is [`m_value`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/590bc615a3120a8f11712220546f9654058b82f0/src/util/result.h#L91) a `union` type when it holds just one member?

1. In [`template <typename T, typename F> class ResultBase`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/590bc615a3120a8f11712220546f9654058b82f0/src/util/result.h#L39-L40), what do `T` and `F` represent conceptually?

1. Why does [#25665](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25665) implement custom [`Construct` methods](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/590bc615a3120a8f11712220546f9654058b82f0/src/util/result.h#L156-L187) instead of just using the regular constructor methods?

1. For which type(s) `T` is [`util::detail::MoveElements(T& src, T& dest)`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/590bc615a3120a8f11712220546f9654058b82f0/src/util/result.h#L23-L28) instantiated? Do you think a templated approach makes sense here?

1. What is the purpose of having differents structs [`Warning` and `Error`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/590bc615a3120a8f11712220546f9654058b82f0/src/util/result.h#L129-L134) when they both just wrap a `bilingual_str`. Could we just use an alias instead?
