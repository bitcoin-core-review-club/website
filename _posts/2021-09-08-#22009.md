## Notes

* [**Coin Selection**](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/coin-selection/) refers to the process of
  picking UTXOs (or coins) from the wallet's UTXO pool to fund a transaction. It is a complex
  problem that involves minimizing short term and long term fees, working with non-guaranteed finality
  of payments, and avoiding privacy leaks. We have covered coin selection in previous review clubs:
  [#17331](/17331), [#17526](/17526), and [#18418](/18418).

* The Bitcoin Core wallet currently implements [two coin selection
  algorithms](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eb09c26724e3f714b613788fc506f2ff3a208d2c/src/wallet/coinselection.h#L169-L172).

  - `KnapsackSolver` is Bitcoin Core's legacy coin selector that reduces the problem to Subset
    Sum and attempts to solve it through 1000 rounds of stochastic approximation. As long as
    the wallet has enough funds to cover the transaction, `KnapsackSolver` always finds a
    solution. It can overshoot, but the wallet just creates a change output to redeem the excess.

  - `SelectCoinsBnB` uses a [Branch and Bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound)
    algorithm to explore a bounded search tree of potential solutions, scoring them with a
    metric called "waste." Notably, the Branch and Bound algorithm looks for an _exact_
    solution and never produces a change output. As such, it's possible for `SelectCoinsBnB`
    to fail even though the wallet has sufficient funds.

  Other coin selection algorithms have also been proposed, such as Single Random Draw in
  [PR #17526](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17526).

* The current behavior in
  [`AttemptSelection()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3755dea3c502f32048b110a4868daefe9dbe3cc1/src/wallet/spend.cpp#L355)
  unconditionally prefers the Branch and Bound solution, and only attempts to use `KnapsackSolver` if
  `SelectCoinsBnB` fails. [PR #22009](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22009) implements a
  `GetSelectionWaste()` function and changes `AttemptSelection()` to try both solvers and pick the
  solution with lower waste, breaking ties by preferring a greater number of inputs.

* **Waste** is measured in satoshis and includes the cost of creating change, the excess selection
  amount, and cost of spending inputs now as opposed to sometime in the future (when we
  expect to be able to consolidate inputs).

  - _Cost of change_ includes the fees paid on this transactions' change output plus the fees
    that will need to be paid to spend it later. If there is no change output, the cost is 0.

  - _Excess selection amount_ refers to the difference between the sum of selected inputs and
    the amount we need to pay (the sum of output values and fees). There shouldn't be any
    excess if there is a change output.

  - _Cost of spending inputs now_ is the fee difference between spending our selected inputs at
     the current feerate and spending them later at the "long term feerate." This helps us
     implement a long term fee-minimization strategy by spending fewer inputs in high feerate
     times and consolidating during low feerate times.

* [PR #22009](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22009) also sets the default long term feerate
  to 10 sats/vbyte, and creates a configuration option, `-consolidatefeerate`. The long term feerate
  represents the feerate at which we would be happy to consolidate UTXOs in transactions.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. Without looking at the waste calculation function, what properties would you consider when
   comparing different coin selection solutions? How might you quantify them?

3. What is the waste calculation equation? How can we verify that the implementation in
   `GetSelectionWaste()` is correct?

4. In what scenario would a coin selection solution have waste == 0?

5. Can a coin selection solution have waste < 0? How?

6. What does the `[[nodiscard]]`
   [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/21566d03d1131f919df65efae7212c18f657f0fd/src/wallet/coinselection.h#L182) attribute do?

7. How did you review the [scripted-diff
   commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22009/commits/32508d9122c329728bb7461988e09feae32829e0)?
(You did review it, right???)

8. What do you think of the 10 sat/vbyte consolidation feerate? What effect does this have on our
   waste calculation method?

9. How does using `m_consolidate_feerate` instead of the 1008-block feerate estimate change our
   wallet's coin selection behavior?
