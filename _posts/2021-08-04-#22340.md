## Notes

- After a block is mined it is broadcasted to the p2p network where the block
  propagates to all nodes through gossiping. There are two methods available
  for block gossip: legacy relay and compact block relay.

  - `Legacy Relay`: A node participating in legacy relaying will always send or
    request entire blocks. For nodes that maintain a mempool this is quite
    bandwidth inefficient, since most of them will likely have most of the
    transactions from a new block within their mempool.

  - `Compact Block Relay`: Compact block relay is specified in [BIP 152](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki).
    The goal is to address the bandwidth inefficiencies of legacy relaying by
    only relaying the transactions of a new block that the requesting peer has not
    yet seen. Check out this [Compact Blocks FAQ](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/06/07/compact-blocks-faq/)
    for bechmarks and more info.

- Bitcoin Core 0.12 introduced a blocks-only setting that can reduce a node's
  bandwidth usage by 88%. The reduction is achieved by not participating in
  transaction relay. For more info check out [this post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1377345.0)
  on blocks-only mode by Gregory Maxwell. Blocks-only nodes currently use
  compact block relaying to download blocks even though they don't maintain
  a full mempool.

- This PR makes blocks-only nodes use legacy relaying to download new blocks.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What is the sequence of messages used in legacy and compact block relaying?

3. Why does compact block relay waist bandwidth for blocks-only nodes during
   block download? How much bandwidth is waisted?

4. Can and should a blocks-only node still serve compact blocks?

5. What is [`PeerManagerImpl::m_ignore_incoming_txs`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/da1c0c64fd094880712d1c4167ad9eb3bb6ffcc6/src/net_processing.cpp#L404)?
   Where and how does this PR use it to achieve its goals?

6. What do you think of [Gleb's comments](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22340#issuecomment-875542706)
   on the usage of `sendrawtransaction`? Can you think of other exceptions in
   which a blocks-only node would still want to download compact blocks?
