## Notes

- After a block is mined it is broadcast to the p2p network where it will eventually
  be relayed to all nodes on the network. There are two methods available
  for relaying blocks: legacy relay and compact block relay.

  - **Legacy Relay**: A node participating in legacy relaying will always send or
    request entire blocks. For nodes that maintain a mempool this is quite
    bandwidth inefficient, since they probably already have most of the
    transactions from a new block in their mempool.

  - **Compact Block Relay**: Compact block relay is specified in [BIP 152](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki).
    The goal is to address the bandwidth inefficiencies of legacy relaying by
    only relaying the transactions of a new block that the requesting peer has not
    yet seen. Check out this [Compact Blocks FAQ](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/06/07/compact-blocks-faq/)
    for bechmarks and more info.

- Bitcoin Core 0.12 introduced a `-blocksonly` setting that can reduce a node's
  bandwidth usage by 88%. The reduction is achieved by not participating in
  transaction relay. For more info check out [this post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1377345.0)
  on blocksonly mode by Gregory Maxwell. Blocksonly nodes currently use
  compact block relaying to download blocks even though they don't maintain
  a full mempool.

- This PR makes blocksonly nodes use legacy relaying to download new blocks.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What is the sequence of messages used in legacy and compact block relaying?

3. Why does compact block relay waste bandwidth for blocksonly nodes during
   block download? How much bandwidth is waisted?

4. Can and should a blocksonly node still serve compact blocks?

5. What is [`PeerManagerImpl::m_ignore_incoming_txs`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/da1c0c64fd094880712d1c4167ad9eb3bb6ffcc6/src/net_processing.cpp#L404)?
   Where and how does this PR use it to achieve its goals?

6. What do you think of [Gleb's comments](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22340#issuecomment-875542706)
   on the usage of `sendrawtransaction`? Can you think of other exceptions in
   which a blocksonly node would still want to download compact blocks?
