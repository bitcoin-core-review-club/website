## Notes

* A [circular dependency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_dependency) exists when two or more
  modules depend on each other. [PR#13695](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13695) added a
  linter which statically analyzes files to detect circular dependencies. At the time, a few already
  existed and were listed in
  [`EXPECTED_CIRCULAR_DEPENDENCIES`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/053a5fc7d912d597cd6dc7376b479420d1eae1c0/test/lint/lint-circular-dependencies.sh#L11).

* One of the circular dependencies in the codebase is validation <-> txmempool. These two modules
  are each heavily depended on by other modules, so their interdependency creates a "domino effect"
  into the rest of the codebase. To experience this for yourself, compile (with ccache), make a small
  edit to protocol.h (where P2P protocol messages are defined), then run `make` again and watch it
  rebuild txmempool and everything mempool-related.

* [PR#22677](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22677) removes this dependency by removing
  txmempool's dependency on validation. It creates a `GetFiltered()` function that allows
  validation and other clients to pass in an arbitrary predicate, iterates through all of its entries,
  applies the predicate function to each of them, and returns the set of filtered iterators to mempool
  entries. This allows validation to apply consensus rules to all of the mempool entries without
  access to the mempool's internals.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What is a circular dependency? Why should we avoid circular dependencies?

3. What functionality lives in validation? What functionality lives in txmempool?

4. Why should/shouldn't validation depend on txmempool? Why should/shouldn't txmempool depend on
   validation?

5. One of the functions that causes txmempool to rely on validation is the `check()` function. What
   checks does it perform, and how does this PR split the checks into two categories?

6. Another function that causes txmempool to rely on validation is the `removeForReorg()` function,
   which calls `CheckSequenceLocks()` and `CheckFinalTx()`. Why do we need to re-check sequence
   locks in a reorg? How is it possible for a coinbase spend to become premature in a reorg?

7. [Clang Thread Safety Analysis
   annotations](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92aad5303b9b96c46015156b5dc96b48e9e7bc76/doc/developer-notes.md#threads-and-synchronization)
   give compile-time warnings about potential race conditions. How do we let the compiler know whether
   `cs_main` is held
   [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr22677/src/validation.cpp#L387)?

8. Do you have any suggestions for alternative approaches to removing this circular dependency?
