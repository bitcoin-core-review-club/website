## Notes

- [`mapRelay`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/153a6882f42fff3fdc63bf770d4c86a62c46c448/src/net_processing.cpp#L924) is a map containing all transactions that we've relayed to any peer recently.
It is accompanied by [`g_relay_expiration`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/153a6882f42fff3fdc63bf770d4c86a62c46c448/src/net_processing.cpp#L926), a sorted list of expiration times for `mapRelay` entries.
Entries stay in `mapRelay` and `g_relay_expiration` [for 15 minutes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/153a6882f42fff3fdc63bf770d4c86a62c46c448/src/net_processing.cpp#L5801).

- When a peer asks for a transaction by sending a `getdata` message but the
transaction is no longer in the mempool, it can be served from `mapRelay`.

- `mapRelay` has been around for a long time, it was already present in the
[first github commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898).
 While it was essential back then, its scope has been reduced over time:
 For example, Bitcoin Core now first tries to fetch transactions directly from the mempool.
 There are other reasons why `mapRelay` wasn't removed earlier
 (see [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27625#issuecomment-1552435967)
 for an overview), but most of these have been made obsolete by other improvements.

- This PR removes `mapRelay` and instead introduces
[`m_most_recent_block_txs`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/fccecd75fed50a59ec4d54d6dc9bd9a406ea6b30#diff-6875de769e90cec84d2e8a9c1b962cdbcda44d870d42e4215827e599e11e90e3R854) to keep track of only the transactions from the most recent block.

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

1. What are the reasons to remove `mapRelay`?

1. Why is the memory usage of `mapRelay` hard to determine? (Hint: see
    [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27625#issuecomment-1544947585))

1. What problem is solved by introducing `m_most_recent_block_txs`?
Do you think it is necessary to introduce it (as opposed to just removing `mapRelay`
without any replacement)?

1. What are the memory requirements for `m_most_recent_block_txs` compared to `mapRelay`?

1. Are there scenarios in which transactions would be made available for a shorter or longer time
than before as a result of this change?

1. Can you think of any other possible downsides of removing `mapRelay`?
