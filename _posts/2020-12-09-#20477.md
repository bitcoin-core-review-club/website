## Notes

* When all inbound connection slots are occupied and a new inbound connection
  is received, the node attempts to evict an existing inbound connection in
  order to open up a slot.

* However, any eviction logic is susceptible to [eclipse
  attacks](https://www.avivz.net/pubs/15/sec15-paper-heilman_final.pdf) (see
  previous review club meetings on [PR 16702](16702#eclipse-attack) and [PR
  17428](17428) for more background on eclipse attacks). An attacker may try to
  make lots of new inbound connections to us, and if we always evict another
  honest node, we may eventually be eclipsed.

* `AttemptToEvictConnection` in `src/net.cpp` contains logic to increase the
  cost of such attacks. Among other things, in order to take over all of the
  inbound slots for a node, the attacker would need to:

  - Obtain IP addresses in various net groups
  - Be amongst the lowest latency peers (geographic cost)
  - Provide us with transactions before other peers
  - Provide us with blocks before other peers

* The scarcity of tests for the eviction logic was first noticed in
  [#16660](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16660) and addressed with
  functional tests in [#16756](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16756)
  ([review club](16756)).

* This PR, [#20477](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20477) refactors
  some of `AttemptToEvictConnection()` into `SelectNodeToEvict()` to increase
  testability and adds unit tests for `SelectNodeToEvict()`.

## Questions

1. Why is it important to allow for evictions? What are the risks in rejecting
   new inbounds if slots are full?

2. What are the various ways `AttemptToEvictConnection()` tries to increase the
   cost of an eclipse attack?

3. Why does `AttemptToEvictConnection` [remove peers being disconnected from
   eviction
   candidates](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f35e4d90/src/net.cpp#L932)
   instead of waiting for them to disconnect (as that would open up a slot)?

4. What is a net group? Why can Bitcoin Core group peers by
   [ASNs](16702#definitions) instead of /16 subnets since
   V0.20 ([issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16599),
   [PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16702))?

5. Can an attacker predict which net groups are most likely to offer them
   protection from eviction?

6. Why is eviction guaranteed if we have at least 29 eviction candidates?

7. Why is non-eviction guaranteed if we have no more than 20 eviction
   candidates? Is 20 the highest number of nodes that guarantees non-eviction?

8. How does the new unit test leverage this information about guaranteed
   eviction and non-eviction?

9. What does `std::move` do
   [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/fbba7d8aada5b1d7a63ad4133dee32533d6700f2#diff-00021eed586a482abdb09d6cdada1d90115abe988a91421851960e26658bed02R1008)?

10. What is the purpose of the `candidate_setup_fn` lambda
    [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/cadd93f35d1bbf662e348a0dee172cdf4af6a903#diff-489a7da84b6a2cfb42207e32a69bf0f92a306310a5d6dc1ec72dc54a32d7817bR809)?
