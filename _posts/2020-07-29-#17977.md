This is the third Review Club meeting on the (work in progress) implementation
of BIP 340-342.  We've previously looked at:

- [O(1) OP_IF/NOTIF/ELSE/ENDIF script implementation / Abstract out script
  execution out of VerifyWitnessProgram()](./16902)
- [Initialize PrecomputedTransactionData in CheckInputScripts and Move
  single-sig checking EvalScript code to EvalChecksig](./18401)

Those preliminary changes have been merged into the master branch in separate PRs.

This week, we'll look at one commit from PR 17977 - _[Implement Taproot
signature
hashing](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/41d08f5d77f52bec0e31bb081d85fff2d67d0467)_.

**Participants are encouraged to review [the notes from the session on
PR18401](./18401) in particular, since we'll be covering a lot of the same
topics this week.**

## Notes

- The _transaction digest_ that is used in signature creation and verification
  is calculated from different parts of the transaction. There are extensive
  notes covering this topic from [our session on
PR18401](https://bitcoincore.reviews/18401#pr-18401-initialize-precomputedtransactiondata-in-checkinputscripts).

- BIP 341 contains [the specification of the new signature validation
  rules](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#signature-validation-rules).

- The [Taproot BIP Review series](https://github.com/ajtowns/taproot-review/)
  covered this topic in [week
  4](https://github.com/ajtowns/taproot-review/blob/master/week-4.md#signature-details).
  [The meeting
  log](http://www.erisian.com.au/meetbot/taproot-bip-review/2019/taproot-bip-review.2019-11-26-19.01.log.html)
  from that review session has more details.

- This week, we'll review the implementation of the Taproot transaction hashing
  algorithm. We won't look at full signature validation. It may be useful to
  check out just up to the commit _Implement Taproot signature hashing (BIP 341)_.
  Specifically, we'll be looking at the `SignatureHashSchnorr()` function in
  `src/script/interpreter.cpp`.

- It's probably most instructive to compare the new `SignatureHashSchnorr()`
  function to the `SignatureHash()` function immediately below, which
  calculates the signature hash for segwit v0 and legacy transactions.

## Questions

1. `SignatureHashSchnorr()` is a templated function. Why?  What types `T` is
   the template function instantiated with? _Hint: look at how the existing
   `SignatureHash()` function is called._

2. `SignatureHashSchnorr()` is passed a `PrecomputedTransactionData*` argument.
   What data is stored in this structure? Why?

3. `SignatureHashSchnorr()` is passed a `hash_type` argument. How many valid
   hash types are there? The `hash_type` parameter is split into `output_type`
   and `input_type` here:

     ```
     // Hash type
     const uint8_t output_type = ...
     const uint8_t input_type = ...
     ```

     How many valid values are there for `output_type` and `input_type`?

4. Just like `SignatureHash()`, the new function creates a local `CHashWriter`
   object. `CHashWriter` is a stream-like object. Other objects can be
   serialized into it (using the `<<` operator), and at the end,
   `CHashWriter::GetHash()` is called to retrieve the digest.

     One difference from `SignatureHash()` is that the `CHashWriter` is
     copy-constructed from `HasherTapSighash`. How is _that_ object constructed, and
     what's the difference from a regular `CHashWriter` object?

5. If the `hash_type` does not have the `ANYONECANPAY` flag, certain parts of
   the transaction are added to the `CHashWriter`. What are those elements, and
   how is that different from `SignatureHash()`?

6. A `spend_type` byte is added the `CHashWriter`. What are the component parts
   of `spend_type`, and what do they indicate? _Hint: refer back to BIP 341 and
   BIP 342._

7. If the `hash_type` indicates `SIGHASH_SINGLE`, there's a check here:

     `if (in_pos >= tx_to.vout.size()) return false;`

     What is that testing, and why?
