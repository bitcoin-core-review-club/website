## Notes

* Bitcoin has various "allow any" consensus rules that can be repurposed in future soft
  forks, such as upgradable NOPs and upgradable witness versions. In the future, if we
  repurpose a NOP opcode (e.g. NOP4 as
  [OP\_CTV](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0119.mediawiki)) or define new semantics
  under a witness version (e.g. witness version 1 for [taproot](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki)), nodes that don't upgrade immediately will still be able
  to stay in consensus when the new rules activate.

* Bitcoin Core's policy [discourages usage of upgradable NOPs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5000),
  witness versions, taproot leaf versions, etc. This prevents nodes from accepting to-be-invalid
  transactions into their mempool prior to activation and miners from building consensus-invalid
  blocks if they don't upgrade.

* [BIP68](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki) and
  [BIP112](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki) introduced
  consensus-enforced semantics on the nSequence field of a [transaction input](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/transactions.html#txin-a-transaction-input-non-coinbase)
  and the `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` opcode to enable relative lock-time spending
  constraints.

    - It specifies the most significant bit of the nSequence field as the _disable locktime flag_ such that, if that bit is
      set, nodes do not apply consensus meaning to the sequence number.

    - The disable locktime flag was
      [documented](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/53e53a33c939949665f60d5eeb82abbb21f97128#diff-a0337ffd7259e8c7c9a7786d6dbd420c80abfa1afdb34ebae3261109d9ae3c19R400-R402)
      as leaving room for "future extensibility," i.e. we might create new relative locktime rules where
      the disable locktime flag is set.

    - However, as there was [at least one
        application](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22871#issuecomment-913094193) in the Bitcoin
      ecosystem using the nSequence field - including the 31st bit - use of this bit was intentionally
      not discouraged in policy.

* [PR #22871](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22871) proposes a policy change to discourage
  use of this bit in nSequence numbers and as arguments to OP\_CSV in the interpreter.

    - The PR author has also written a [blog
      post](https://rubin.io/bitcoin/2021/09/03/upgradable-nops-flaw/) about this unexpected
      behavior.

    - The author of the BIP112 implementation
      [explained](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22871#issuecomment-913413578) why this
      policy was not added originally and
      [noted](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22871#issuecomment-913094193) that this change makes
      sense now only if there are no more applications using the disable locktime flag for non-consensus
      purposes in their nSequence numbers, as it would prohibit their transactions from propagating.

* The PR author [posted to the mailing
  list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019400.html)
  soliciting feedback on this proposal.

    - Dave Harding
      [noted](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019402.html) on the
      mailing list that upgrades to relative timelock semantics would also be gated on a different nVersion number.

    - Pieter Wuille [commented](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22871#issuecomment-915689161)
      that, since nVersion numbers greater than 2 are discouraged in policy, this method of upgrading
      relative timelocks is preserved without discouraging use of the locktime disable flag.

    - Antoine Poinsot
      [noted](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019407.html)
      on the mailing list that the Lightning Network protocol uses nSequence numbers to encode
      commitment transaction numbers, including the disable locktime flag.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. Can you summarize the changes being proposed in this PR?

3. What is the difference between policy and consensus rules?

4. Why do we discourage the usage of upgradable NOPs in policy? How is this implemented? (Hint: grep
   for `SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS` in src/script/interpreter.cpp).

5. What are some reasons to discourage use of the locktime disable flag in policy?

6. What are some reasons **not** to discourage use of the locktime disable flag in policy?

7. What do you think of the
   [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22871#issuecomment-915689161) and
   [response](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019403.html) about
   upgrading the relative timelock semantics by increasing the nVersion number?

8. Do you think this change (discouragement of setting the most significant bit) should be applied
   to nSequence numbers, CSV values, both, or neither? Why?

10. What do you think of the approach of reusing the `SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS`
   script verification flag to discourage use of the locktime disable flag?

<!-- 9. Why is [this
   commit](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/e5b2a824147c342bfbf2c8b1696afc686c2bfda7),
   which removes the `SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS` script verification flag from static
   OP\_CSV tests, needed?

   This commit is no longer part of the PR. TODO: update or remove this question. -->
