## Notes

### Motivations and Background
- Miners use a mempool to store and sort unconfirmed transactions that they can include in blocks to collect their fees.
  Block building (done by the
[`BlockAssembler`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/cdc32994feadf3f15df3cfac5baae36b4b011462/src/node/miner.h#L145))
is the process of selecting ~4MWu worth of mempool transactions while trying to maximize the total fees.
- Non-mining nodes might never use the block builder, but are still interested in comparing the incentive compatibility
  of transactions as a metric for whether it is worth keeping: if the mempool exceeds its maximum memory allowance, it
should evict the transactions that are least likely to be mined soon.
- The [block building algorithm](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/cdc32994feadf3f15df3cfac5baae36b4b011462/src/node/miner.cpp#L296)
on master uses ancestor set-based sort to dynamically linearize mempool transactions by including ancestor sets in order of
highest **ancestor score** (minimum between ancestor feerate and individual feerate). As transactions are included,
their descendants' ancestor scores can change; the `BlockAssembler` keeps a copy of mempool entries with their updated
ancestor information in a separate map, which avoids modifying the mempool itself. We covered this algorithm in more
detail in a [previous meeting](/26152).
- In effect, ancestor set-based sorting produces a linearization of mempool transactions (from most to least likely
  to be mined), though they have not been called as such.
- Notably, the only way to determine the linearization position of a mempool transaction this way is to run the
  block building algorithm until this transaction is selected. This means that finding the "least likely to be
mined" transaction (e.g. for eviction) requires building an entire mempool worth of block templates.
- Instead, eviction runs a similar algorithm but with ascending **descendant score** (maximum between descendant
  feerate and individual feerate). This also linearizes transactions in an approximate order of least to most likely
to be mined, but the linearization is not exactly opposite to the result of ancestor set-based sorting. This asymmetry
is problematic:
    - What if the first transaction selected for eviction is also the transaction that would be selected first for
      mining? This cache eviction strategy is throwing away the most useful piece of data.
    - Similarly, what if we have transactions that are "junk" (e.g. fall below the node's configured `-blockmintxfee`
      and would thus never be selected for mining) but can't be kicked out because they have a high descendant score?
    This mempool limitation necessitated the requirement that package transaactions be above the minimum relay feerate
  (see [PR #26933](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933)).
- Due to similar limitations, Replace-by-Fee code cannot properly determine whether the proposed replacement(s) are, so
  it uses approximations like individual feerate comparisons. These imperfect heuristics lead to pinning problems and
fee-bumping inefficiencies.

### TxGraph
- The [main motivations](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27677#eviction-mining-not-opposite) for cluster mempool
  are to address these problems.
- A cluster mempool essentially keeps the entire mempool linearized at all times (lazily using `TxGraph`), which
  makes it easy to quickly determine a transactions linearization position (including what the highest and lowest
transactions are) and compare the current mempool with a potential one.
[PR #31444](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31444) adds `TxGraph` functionality to assist in selecting
transactions for block building and eviction:
    - `TxGraph` adds a chunk index, a total ordering of all chunks in the graph across all clusters. A
      [`ChunkOrder`
comparator](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/3429e9d79df1336cf1d0a61cb5f9bf028aa860b2#diff-c25ebcc6e4dc9c9bb21462f796fbb470cee3f0ff1e77bfc4033f4e8460f4482cR282)
defines the order in which chunks would be mined.
    - `BlockBuilder` can just iterate through the chunks in order. Also, since a total orderering of all graph entries
      exists, we can get the “least likely to be mined” transaction without building a full mempool worth of block
templates: simply take the last chunk in the index.
    - `TxGraph` exposes a `BlockBuilder` to iterate over the chunks from best to worst. `BlockBuilder` can `Skip` chunks (i.e.
      if they are too large to fit in the remaining block space), and those chunks' descendants will be subsequently
skipped as well.
    - `TxGraph` also exposes a `GetWorstMainChunk` method to identify the transactions that would be included in a block last.
- The PR also adds a `GetMainStagingDiagrams` method to make it possible to compare the feerate diagram of the `TxGraph`
  with and without its staged changes.
- We have reviewed `TxGraph` basic functionality in a previous [meeting](/31363). If `TxGraph` is new to you, it may be
  easier to get feel for `TxGraph` by first reviewing `SimTxGraph` in the fuzzer, which has similar functionality but a
far simpler design:
    - It uses a single `DepGraph` to represent all transactions across all clusters, which means it doesn’t need to implement merges or track much information about the set of clusters.
    - It implements the staging level by creating a copy of main and deleting either the main or the staing to commit or abort staged changes. This approach is more memory-intensive but doesn’t need to track the differences between the levels.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?
1. Why are block building and eviction relevant to each other? Wouldn’t it be easier to evict transactions by the order
   they entered the mempool?
1. What is `GetMainStagingDiagrams` useful for? Why might we exclude the clusters that are identical in main and staging?
1. True / false: if all clusters are singletons (have 1 transaction each), `m_main_chunkindex` would just be sorting
   the transactions in order by feerate.
1. In english, using the approach in this PR, what is the algorithm for selecting transactions in order for block building? And for eviction?
1. In pseudocode, how would a client of `BlockBuilder` use it to build a block? When would `GetCurrentChunk`, `Include`, and `Skip` be called?
1. What is the expected lifetime of `BlockBuilder` (is it similar to `CTxMemPool`’s or very different)? 
1. Can you create a `BlockBuilder` when staging exists? Can you build a block using the `TxGraph`’s state with its staged changes?
1. Does `BlockBuilder` modify `TxGraph` (a "yes and no"-style answer is ok)?
1. Why does `BlockBuilder` need to remember the set of skipped transactions? Why can it be represented as a set of Clusters?
1. [This commit](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/3429e9d79df1336cf1d0a61cb5f9bf028aa860b2)
   adds new fields in data structures that need to point to each other: `Entry` now contains an iterator to the
transaction’s `ChunkData` in `m_main_chunkindex`, and `ChunkData` refrence `Entry`s by their position in `m_entries`. In
your review, how did you check that these pointers are always kept up-to-date?
1. Conceptually, what are all the ways that an entry's chunk index can change?
1. In the [`ChunkOrder` comparator](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/3429e9d79df1336cf1d0a61cb5f9bf028aa860b2#diff-c25ebcc6e4dc9c9bb21462f796fbb470cee3f0ff1e77bfc4033f4e8460f4482cR288),
when `cmp_feerate != 0`, why can it be returned directly without comparing position within the cluster?
1. How many observers of a `TxGraphImpl` can exist at a time, and why (why is `m_main_chunkindex_observers` an integer instead of a boolean)? Does that mean we could have multiple blocks being built?
1. This
   [call](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/b363f261b099d44b1e19d73d983f4f84e1e3d5f8#diff-c25ebcc6e4dc9c9bb21462f796fbb470cee3f0ff1e77bfc4033f4e8460f4482cR2394)
to `GetClusterRefs` gets the vector of `Ref`s corresponding to the chunk. Why are the arguments `ret.first` and
`start_pos = chunk_end_entry.m_main_lin_index + 1 - chunk_data.m_chunk_count` correct?
1. Continued from the last question, why is `std::reverse` called on the result?
