## Notes

This PR is one change in a sequence of PRs making the bitcoin wallet code more
asynchronous and independent of node code, so the node can be more robust and
performant, and not get locked up while wallet code is executing. The changes
are also supposed to be architecture improvements, making the wallet/node
interface more high-level and less tied to implementation details of the node
and wallet. They also get wallet code closer to being able to work offline or in
a different process without constantly having to query the node for information.
Notable PRs making wallet code more asynchronous are:

- [#10286](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10286) by TheBlueMatt –
changing the wallet to process `BlockConnected`, `BlockDisconnected`, and other
notifications from the node asynchronously, adding
`CWallet::m_last_block_processed` field

- [#15931](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15931) by ariard – changing
the wallet to cache block heights, adding
`CWallet::m_last_block_processed_height` and `CWalletTx::m_confirm.block_height`
fields, and using cached heights to avoid needing to call
`Chain::Lock::getBlockDepth()` to determine transaction status.

- [#17443](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17443) by ariard, pending
review – using cached block heights to avoid needing to call Chain::checkFinalTx
to determine transaction status

- [#17954](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17954) by ryanofsky, this pr
– using cached block heights and `CWallet::m_last_block_processed` in various
wallet functions to avoid the need to call `Chain::Lock`, and to make the wallet
return internally-consistent information when `m_last_block_processed` lags
behind the current node tip

- [#16426](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16426) by ariard, pending
review – removing the `interfaces::Chain::Lock` class altogether to remove a way
wallets could lock up the node unintentionally or longer than needed

All interactions between the wallet and node code happen though the
[`interfaces::Chain`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/470664f2b788e2cce9202991d11476a6fef00ef4/src/interfaces/chain.h#L54)
and
[`interfaces::Chain::Lock`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/470664f2b788e2cce9202991d11476a6fef00ef4/src/interfaces/chain.h#L64)
interfaces. Generally the less the wallet needs to call these interface methods,
the more efficient both the node and the wallet can be. Also the simpler wallet
code can be because it can avoid the headache of having to reconcile its cached
state with latest information returned from the node, in cases where
`CWallet::m_last_block_processed` has fallen behind the current node tip.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PRs? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
(Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub.)

2. What happens in the `interfaces::Chain::Lock` chain constructor and
destructor? What is the effect of writing `auto locked_chain =
pwallet->chain().lock();`?

3. What's the difference between calling `interfaces::Chain::getHeight()` and
`CWallet::GetLastBlockHeight()`? When will the values be the same, and when will
they be different?

4. In commit ["wallet: Avoid use of Chain::Lock in
listsinceblock"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17954/commits/e276b6821430ec2c18aba55137daf98bae770054),
when `listsinceblock` is called with a non-null block hash, how does the change
replacing `locked_chain->getHeight()` prevent `pwallet->GetLastBlockHeight()`
transactions that are older than the specified block from being mistakenly
printed?

5. Trickier: In the same commit, how does the change from
`locked_chain->getBlockHash(last_height)` to `pwallet->GetLastBlockHash()`
result in a more accurate `"lastblock"` value that won't result in missing
transactions when passed to a subsequent `listsinceblock` call?

6. In the same commit, what is the `coinbaseKey.MakeNewKey(true)` line doing,
and why does the test fail if it is removed?

7. In commit ["wallet: Avoid use of Chain::Lock in
importmulti"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17954/commits/b91020a919d445dee91e908969ba8f964dd2ca4b),
what was the removed `fRescan = false` statement intended to do? Why is it safe
to drop?
