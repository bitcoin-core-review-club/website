## Notes

### Motivation & context
* For years Bitcoin Core has shipped **five** separate user‑facing binaries.
  The upcoming *multiprocess* work would add at least two more (`bitcoin‑node`,
  `bitcoin‑gui`). Reviewers feared an explosion of filenames
  and user [confusion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31827).
* The PR introduces a **single command‑line front‑end** called **`bitcoin`**
  that does *no* consensus or wallet work itself – it simply chooses and
  `exec()`’s the appropriate helper binary:

  | `bitcoin` sub‑command       | Traditional binary         | Multiprocess binary (`-m`) |
  | --------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
  | `bitcoin gui …`            | `bitcoin‑qt`               | `bitcoin‑gui`               |
  | `bitcoin daemon …`         | `bitcoind`                 | `bitcoin‑node`              |
  | `bitcoin rpc …`            | `bitcoin‑cli -named …`     | `bitcoin‑cli -named …`      |
  | `bitcoin wallet …`         | `bitcoin‑wallet`           | `bitcoin-wallet`            |
  | `bitcoin tx …`             | `bitcoin‑tx`               | `bitcoin-tx`                |

  The `bitcoin` wrapper therefore accomplishes the “side‑binaries + unified entry point”
  idea discussed in [issue #30983](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30983).

### New util helpers
* **`util::ExecVp()`** – thin, cross‑platform `execvp` replacement.
  * POSIX: directly forwards to `execvp`.
  * Windows: builds a *quoted & escaped* command line that
    `CommandLineToArgvW` in the child process will parse identically to POSIX
    argv rules.
  * Escaping rules follow the MSVCRT specification: backslashes are doubled only
    when they precede a quote, and every internal quote is back‑slash‑escaped.

* **`util::GetExePath()`** – attempts to resolve `argv[0]` into the executable
  file path.
  * On *Unix*: uses either the literal `argv[0]` (if it contains a slash) **or**
    searches each element of `$PATH` until a regular file is found.
  * On Windows: uses `GetModuleFileNameW(nullptr, …)`.

### Wrapper lookup logic (`ExecCommand`)
1. Determine the directory of the wrapper itself (resolves symlinks).
2. Try possible candidate paths for the target binary, in descending priority:
   * *libexec dir* – `${prefix}/libexec/<target>` if wrapper is in `${prefix}/bin/`
   * Windows installer “daemon” sub‑dir `${wrapper_dir}/daemon/<target>`
   * *Sibling* – `${wrapper_dir}/<target>`
   * Finally, rely on the **system PATH** *only* if the wrapper itself was
     invoked via PATH search (mitigates accidentally running an old system
     `bitcoind` while testing a local build).
3. Call `util::ExecVp()` with each candidate, moving onto the next candidate
   if it returns `ENOENT` ("No such file or directory") and raising an exception
   if a different error is returned or if there is no next candidate.

### Build‑system & test changes
* CMake option **`BUILD_BITCOIN_BIN`** (ON by default) builds/installs the
  wrapper.
* Functional test framework understands `BITCOIN_CMD="bitcoin -m"` so the
  entire suite can be driven through the new CLI.
* CI jobs for the multiprocess build now export that variable.
* Static‑analysis suppression: the wrapper intentionally contains *no* FORTIFY
  functions; `security-check.py` is taught to ignore it.

### Documentation updates
Numerous docs now mention that `bitcoin rpc`, `bitcoin daemon`, etc. are
synonyms for the traditional commands, improving discoverability for new
users while remaining fully backwards‑compatible.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

1. **Review approach** – did you test the wrapper?  Did you try both
   monolithic (`bitcoin daemon`) and multiprocess (`bitcoin -m daemon`)
   modes? (requires `-DENABLE_IPC=ON` cmake option). Attempt to
   run one of the `strace` or `dtrace` tracing commands suggested in `bitcoin.cpp`?
   Any cross‑platform checks?

1. From [issue #30983](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30983), four
   packaging strategies were listed.
   *Which specific drawbacks of the* “side‑binaries” *approach does this PR
   address?*

1. In `util::ExecVp()` (Windows branch) why is a **second** `std::vector`
   `escaped_args` needed instead of modifying `argv` in‑place?

1. Walk through the escaping algorithm in `util::ExecVp` for the argument
   `C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt`.
   *What exact string is passed to `_execvp()`?*

1. `GetExePath()` does **not** use `readlink("/proc/self/exe")` on Linux even
   though it would be more direct.  What advantages does the current
   implementation have?  What corner cases might it miss?

1. In `ExecCommand`, explain the purpose of the `fallback_os_search` Boolean.
   Under what circumstances is it better to avoid letting the OS search for
   the binary on the PATH?

1. The wrapper searches `${prefix}/libexec` **only when it detects that it is
   running from an installed `bin/` directory**.  Why not always search
   `libexec`?

1. The functional test layer now conditionally prepends `bitcoin -m` to every
   command.  How does this interact with *backwards‑compatibility testing*
   where older releases are run in the same test suite?

1. The PR adds an exemption in `security-check.py` because the wrapper contains no
   fortified glibc calls.
   *Why* does it not contain them, and would adding a trivial `printf` to
   `bitcoin.cpp` break reproducible builds under the current rules?

1. Discuss an alternative design: linking a *static* table of sub‑commands to
   absolute paths at **build** time instead of computing them at **run**
   time.  What trade‑offs (deployment, relocatability, reproducibility)
   influenced the chosen design?

1. Suppose a user installs only `bitcoin` (wrapper) and *forgets* to install
   `bitcoin-cli`.  Describe the failure mode when they run `bitcoin rpc
   getblockcount`.  Would it be better for the wrapper to pre‑check the
   availability of the target binary?

1. (Forward‑looking) Once `bitcoin-gui` actually spawns `bitcoin-node`
   automatically (after [#10102](http://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102)
   lands), what additional command‑line options or UX changes might the wrapper
   need?

1. Typing `bitcoin --version` prints wrapper metadata, *not* `bitcoind`’s or `bitcoin‑qt`’s.
   *Is that the right UX?*
   Propose a mechanism for the wrapper to forward `--version` and `--help` to the underlying sub‑command when one is specified (e.g. `bitcoin --version daemon`).

1. The wrapper is agnostic to options such as `-ipcbind` passed down to `bitcoin‑node`.
   *Should the wrapper eventually enforce a policy (e.g. refuse to forward `-ipcconnect` unless `-m` is given)?*
   What might go wrong if a user mixes monolithic binaries with IPC flags?

1. `BITCOIN_CMD="bitcoin -m"` is parsed with `shlex`; spaces inside quotes are preserved.
   Should the framework use an explicit list instead of shell parsing?

1. Would it ever make sense to ship **only** the wrapper in `bin/` and relocate
   all other executables to `libexec/` to tidy PATH?
