## Notes

- The [REST interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3bf40d06a22ee1c547d2924d109b8e185ddbf5ef/doc/REST-interface.md)
  is a lightweight interface that serves public data over HTTP on the same port
  as the JSON-RPC interface. It can be enabled using the `-rest` config option.  

- Endpoint examples:

  - Query transactions by their ID: `/rest/tx/<TX-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` 
  - Query blocks: `/rest/block/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` 
  - Query the contents of a node's mempool: `/rest/mempool/contents.json`

- Most of the endpoints support responding in three different formats: binary,
  hex string or json.

- Just like the JSON-RPC interface it is not recommended to expose the REST
  interface to the public.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What are the main differences between the JSON-RPC and REST interface?

3. The JSON-RPC interface is already capable of serving blockfilters, why do we
   want this ability for the REST interface?

4. There is a [NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17631#issuecomment-940633673)
   ([#23259](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23259)) on the PR
   suggesting that the REST interface should be removed entirely in favour
   of external proxy servers. Do you agree? Why/why not?
