## Notes

- Bitcoin transactions consist of
  [transaction inputs](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/transactions.html#txin-a-transaction-input-non-coinbase),
  which each refer to an output that is being spent by txid and index, and
  [transaction outputs](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/transactions.html#txout-a-transaction-output),
  which each contain an amount and a spending condition (encoded as a
  scriptPubKey).

- The transaction fee is the total amount from the transaction inputs minus
  the total amount spent by the transaction outputs.

- Since the transaction inputs do not explicitly include the amounts, the
  only way to determine the transaction fee is to look up the UTXOs (unspent
  transaction outputs) that are being spent in this transaction. In other
  words, the transaction fee is _implicit_.

- For transactions in the mempool, the UTXOs spent by the transaction will
  either be in the UTXO set (the set of all UTXOs implied by the block chain
  at the current height), or will be the outputs from other transactions in
  the mempool

- For transactions that are already spent in the block chain, the UTXO data
  is saved in
  [undo data](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c9dd5c8d6/src/undo.h).

- The
  [getrawtransaction](https://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/0.21.0/rpc/rawtransactions/getrawtransaction/)
  RPC method can be used to retrieve a transaction. The transaction can
  either be an unconfirmed transaction in the mempool or a confirmed
  transaction which has been saved in a block file on disk.

- This PR updates the `getrawtransaction` RPC method to allow the user to
  retrieve fee data for a transaction.

- This PR is similar to [#18772](https://bitcoincore.reviews/18772), which
  added fee data to the `getblock` RPC method. We covered that PR
  in a [previous PR Review Club meeting](https://bitcoincore.reviews/18772).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. This PR [changes the second argument](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/f30f007c829547e44cac4214c04a0fa7d0ddc3c2#diff-a58e7bb9d9a8a0287c0b7281d99da4e79b6f8c2a5780c24c6d76c14212c48640R90)
   of `getrawtransaction` from `verbose` (a bool) to `verbosity` (an int).
   Is this ok? Does it break backwards compatibility?

1. Why is there [a new entry added to
   vRPCConvertParams](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/f30f007c829547e44cac4214c04a0fa7d0ddc3c2#diff-84c7a7f36362b9724c31e5dec9879b2f81eae0d0addbc9c0933c3558c577de65R96)?
   What is `vRPCConvertParams` used for?

1. The `verbosity` argument accepts values of `0` (returns the hex-encoded
   data for the transaction), `1` (returns an object with information about
   the transaction) or `2` (returns an object with information about the
   transaction, including fees and prevout information for the inputs). What
   happens if `3` is passed as the argument? How about `-1`?

1. The commit introduces
   [local variables](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/f30f007c829547e44cac4214c04a0fa7d0ddc3c2#diff-a58e7bb9d9a8a0287c0b7281d99da4e79b6f8c2a5780c24c6d76c14212c48640R227-R228)
   `blockUndo` and `block` in the `getrawtransaction()` function. What are
   they used for? How/where do they get set?

1. What does
   [this new for loop](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/f30f007c829547e44cac4214c04a0fa7d0ddc3c2#diff-a58e7bb9d9a8a0287c0b7281d99da4e79b6f8c2a5780c24c6d76c14212c48640R233-R240)
   do?

1. Are there any performance implications of that loop? Do they matter?

1. `TxToJSON()` now _always_ 
   [calls TxToUniv() with verbosity set to TxVerbosity::SHOW_DETAILS_AND_PREVOUT](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/f30f007c829547e44cac4214c04a0fa7d0ddc3c2#diff-a58e7bb9d9a8a0287c0b7281d99da4e79b6f8c2a5780c24c6d76c14212c48640R54),
   even if the RPC user called the function with `verbosity` set to 1. Is
   that ok? Why/why not?
