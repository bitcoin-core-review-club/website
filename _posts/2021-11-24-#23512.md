## Notes

- Policy or transaction relay policy describes which transactions are
  considered for P2P relay by a node. Generally, any transactions added to the
  transaction memory pool are valid according to consensus and policy rules.

- While all nodes on the network are assumed to agree on consensus rules, they
  might not agree on policy rules. For example, at times of high transaction
  throughput, some peers might reject consensus-valid transactions with
  insufficient fee.

- Moreover, policy rules often change between software releases. For example if
  a node receives a transaction that requires validation rules of a consensus
  change it is not yet aware of, it may reject the loose transaction out of
  caution even though the transaction will be valid in a block.

- This pull request changes a policy rule of Taproot-spending transactions.
  Previously it was only possible to send Taproot-spends after the Taproot
  deployment activated, now it is possible at any time.


## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. Which places use the status of the Taproot deployment? Which of those
   are policy related? Hint: Search for `Consensus::DEPLOYMENT_TAPROOT`, for
   example with `git grep 'Consensus::DEPLOYMENT_TAPROOT'`.

1. Which function was responsible to check if a transaction has a Taproot
   input? Hint: Start looking in
   [MemPoolAccept::PreChecks](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/fa3e0da06b491b8c0fa2dbae37682a9112c9deb8/src/validation.cpp#L601).

1. How does the pull request change the function? Is the return value or
   the function signature changed?

1. Does this pull request change the handling of consensus-invalid
   transactions?

1. Are there any (theoretical) issues with the change? If yes, give examples of
   adverse effects. Hint: Is the Taproot activation set in stone? What happens
   if a wallet creates a transaction with Taproot inputs before Taproot is
   active?

1. (bonus question) Is it theoretically possible for a mainnet chain to exist
   that has Taproot not activated or activated at a different block height?

1. (bonus question) Does this change affect miners running this code? Assume
   that the miner is running on a chain that has Taproot not active. Would the
   miner attempt to include the transaction in a block? Hint: Look at
   [CreateNewBlock](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/fa3e0da06b491b8c0fa2dbae37682a9112c9deb8/src/miner.cpp#L102).
