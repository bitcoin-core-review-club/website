## Notes

* [Erlay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10518) is a proposed transaction relay protocol change to reduce the bandwidth used to
  announce transactions.

  - We looked at Erlay in [a previous review club](/18261).

  - For this PR, it might make sense to overview [the full PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21515) again
    (note that this is a different PR number from what's above because that one was closed), and
    [the updated BIP](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki).
    Don't spend too much time on it though, the overall understanding of the protocol is sufficient.

* [PR #23443](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23443) contains the first batch of commits
  enabling Erlay:

  - A node becomes able to negotiate the support for Erlay with another node by sending/receiving
    a new p2p message.

  - Once the handshake is done, the node also initializes the "reconciliation state", a variable to
    keep track of ongoing reconciliations with a particular peer.

  - If the peer is disconnected, the corresponding reconciliation state should be cleared.

* We moved forward with this PR once [minisketch](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/minisketch/) was
  merged, although minisketch is not required for this particular Erlay sub-PR. Another dependency
  was [PR #18044: "Use wtxid for transaction
  relay"](https://bitcoincore.reviews/18044). We have discussed minisketch in
  previous review clubs, [python part 1](/minisketch-26), [python part
  2](/minisketch-26-2), and [C++ implementation](/minisketch).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What are the benefits of splitting PRs into smaller parts? Are there any drawbacks to this
   approach? How might you review sub-PRs differently?

3. When are the nodes supposed to announce Erlay support? What should they consider before doing
   so and in which cases would it be clearly meaningless?

4. What is the overall handshake and "registration for reconciliation" protocol flow?

5. Why is the `version` field of
   [`sendrecon`](https://github.com/naumenkogs/bips/blob/bip_0330_updates/bip-0330.mediawiki#sendrecon)
   useful? Under which conditions it should be bumped?

6. What is the reason for generating reconciliation salt (`m_local_salts`)? How is it generated
   and why?

7. This PR adds 4 new conditions under which nodes will disconnect a peer. What are they?
   When does it make sense to disconnect a peer rather than just ignore the message?

8. What does `TxReconciliationTracker::Impl::m_mutex` guard and when does the lock need to be held?

9. Why might we use a `std::unordered_map` instead of a `std::map` to track salts and states?
