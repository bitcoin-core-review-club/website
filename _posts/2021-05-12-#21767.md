## Notes

- This PR is part of a project to _de-globalize g_chainman_. [Issue
  20049](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20049) describes the high-level
  goal and motivations for that project. This topic was also discussed in a
  previous review club on [PR 20158](/20158), "De-globalize ChainstateManager."

- [g_chainman](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5925f1e65/src/validation.cpp#L102)
  is currently a _global_ variable, or in other words, a _non-local static
  storage duration variable_. Global variables are [initialized during
  startup](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/initialization#Non-local_variables),
  before the `main()` function is invoked.

- Usage of global variables makes it difficult to modularize the code base:

  - Since the variable is initialized before `main()`, it can't be constructed
    with parameters that are only known at runtime (e.g. configuration
    options).
  - It's difficult to test global objects, since the test can't
    construct/destruct new instances of the object, and other components may
    make changes to the global object during the test.
  - There's no concept of ownership of a global object. We have no control over
    when the memory for the object is allocated or freed, or the order in which
    different global objects are constructed/destructed.
  - The use of globals leads to tight coupling between components. Other
    components will have undocumented dependencies on the global object, which
    makes it difficult to enforce a well-defined interface to the object.

- The [NodeContext
  object](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5925f1e65/src/node/context.h#L39-L64)
  was added in [PR 16839](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16839). The PR description
  and code comment clearly describe the rationale and benefits of managing the subcomponents
  in this way.

- Over time, other subcomponents have been moved to the `NodeContext` object,
  for example `CTxMemPool` ([PR
  19556](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19556)) and
  `CBlockPolicyEstimator` ([PR
  18766](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18766)).

- The end goal of [issue 20049](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20049) is
  to remove the global `g_chainman`, so that [the ChainstateManager object is
  owned by the NodeContext
  object](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21866/commits/8135fd659).

- [PR 21767](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21767) removes the usage
  of `g_chainman` in various components.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
   What was your review approach?

2. This PR is a refactor and is not supposed to change any functional behaviour. What
   are some ways we can verify that behaviour doesn't change?

3. This series of PRs is part of a larger project to "modularize our consensus
   engine". What are some of the benefits of doing that?

4. Briefly, what are each of the following classes responsible for:

   - `ChainstateManager`
   - `CChainState`
   - `CChain`
   - `BlockManager`

5. What is `cs_main`? Why does it feature so prominently in the changes in this PR?

6. In commit [rest: Add GetChainman function and use
   it](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21767/commits/70a826bbb), what does the
   `EnsureAnyChainman()` function do? Why is it being removed from `rest.cpp`?

7. What does the following code do?

   `assert(std::addressof(g_chainman.m_blockman) == std::addressof(chainman.m_blockman));`

   Why is it added in this PR (and other PRs in the series)?

8. Why does the last commit in [PR
   21866](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21866) change
   `NodeContext.chainman` from a raw pointer to a `std::unique_ptr`? What
   ownership semantics does a unique_ptr connote? What are the benefits of
   using a _smart pointer_ (unique_ptr or shared_ptr) over a _raw pointer_?
