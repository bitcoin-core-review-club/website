## Notes

* In C++, unsigned integer overflow is well defined and often used by design.
 Signed integer overflow, on the other hand, is [undefined behavior](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ub).

* In practice, signed integer overflow will usually manifest by "wrapping
  around". For example, adding two postive values `int{0x7ffffffd}` and
  `int{10}` will result in a negative value of `-2147483641`.

* This doesn't mean that signed integers should be avoided. In fact, signed
  integers should normally be preferred for arithmetic calculations such as
  addition or subtraction. Care should be taken to pick an integer width that
  is large enough to fit all possible values at runtime. Commonly, this is
  `int`, `int32_t`, or `int64_t`. User provided values should also be checked
  to be in range as early as possible.

* Compilers such as gcc and clang can instrument the binary to detect signed
  integer overflow with the flag
  [`-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html).
  In Bitcoin Core it can be set via `./configure --with-sanitizers=signed-integer-overflow`.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. What does the `prioritisetransaction` RPC do?

1. Were you able to compile Bitcoin Core with the `signed-integer-overflow` sanitizer?
   Were you able to reproduce the bug manually by calling the RPC or by running the fuzz
   test?

1. Why is it *impossible* to fix this issue by limiting the range of possible
   values a user can enter?
