## Notes

See notes from the [first part of this review club](/27255).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
What was your review approach?

1. In Miniscript, we have type modifiers, which guarantee additional properties for an expression. [866284d](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/866284d007993551f681809d9e48175a3b0fe0c1) makes the wrapper "**d:**" have the "**u**" property under Tapscript.
	* What is the "**d:**" wrapper and the "**u**" type modifier?
	* Why is it that we can make **d:** have the **u** property here? Why not in non-Tapscript Miniscript?

1. This PR adds some logic for statically ensuring no spending path exceeds the stack size at execution time:
	* Why does this matter for Tapscript?
	* What's the approach taken by this PR? What are the pros/cons? (hint: [efdd154](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/efdd1543597aff49c56a1abaa75b574be3b330db))
	* Can you think of an alternative approach to ensure no spending path exceeds the stack size?

1. In [e81635c](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/e81635c39d99a158629544fefd765b3994f3d7c4), the scripts are optionally padded during fuzzing. Why?

1. What is the most significant change to the descriptor logic in this PR (hint: [08db38a](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/08db38aca2fe9169b39507d928c1094be2116ad4)). Why is it needed?
