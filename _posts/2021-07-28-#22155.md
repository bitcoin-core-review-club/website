## Notes

- The `CreateTransaction()` function constructs a transaction based on a list of `CRecipient` objects. We can
  think of the resulting transaction as a redistribution of the input coins to new owners in three
  different categories (not all are mandatory):

  - Recipients: Outputs are created for each of the recipients specified when creating the transaction.

  - Miner: The miner can claim the difference between the transaction's inputs and outputs as part of their
    mining reward. While it's possible to create a transaction with no fee, miners are less likely to
    mine it and Bitcoin Core nodes won't accept it into their mempools.

  - Self: The wallet might create a change output back to itself if the inputs exceed the amount needed for
    the payment(s) and fees. This output isn't necessarily present in every transaction.

- Before selecting inputs, the wallet calculates a *target amount* based on the total payment
  amount(s) and fees. If a `CRecipient` has `fSubtractFeeAmount=true`, the fee is deducted from the
  payment, and thus included in the target amount instead of added to it.

- If a change output would be dust (i.e. it's not economical to create and spend the output because the
  fee is higher than the amount), it is "dropped" and absorbed into one of the other payments.
  The expected behavior is to put it back into the recipient output(s) rather than giving it to the miner.


## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. The commit message for [the first
   commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22155/commits/2565478c813fb7278153b113de4b9338fc186872)
   notes "no change in behavior." How might your review strategy differ based on whether a commit is
   supposed to change behavior?

3. What does the `CreateSyncedWallet()` function do? Are there any other places where it could be
   reused?

4. What does it mean to "subtract fee from recipient" when creating a transaction?

5. What behavior that "might have recently changed in #17331" is being tested in `spend_tests.cpp`?
   What does `TestChain100Setup` do for us? Why is it needed?

6. Why is there an extra `::` in front of `cs_main`? (Hint: (`::`) is called a scope resolution operator). Why are these lines enclosed in their own scope?

7. What is the value of `fee` set in [this
   line](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fe6dc76b7c9c5405f37464a3b19fcf82aaf22861/src/wallet/test/spend_tests.cpp#L44)?

8. What exactly does
   [`check_tx`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fe6dc76b7c9c5405f37464a3b19fcf82aaf22861/src/wallet/test/spend_tests.cpp#L25-L40)
   do?

9. The lambda `check_tx`
   [_captures_](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda#Lambda_capture) the local variable,
   `std::unique_ptr<CWallet> wallet`, by reference, so that it can be used in the lambda function. Why
   is this capture by reference instead of by value? Hint: to capture the variable `var` by value, the
   capture clause (also known as lambda introducer) must be `[var]` instead of `[&var]`.

10. Can you think of any other test cases that should be added?
