## Notes

* **Replace by Fee (RBF)** is a method of fee-bumping a transaction by creating a higher-feerate
  replacement transaction that spends the same inputs as their original transaction.
[BIP125](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki) specifies how users can
signal replaceability in their transactions and a set of conditions that replacement transactions
must meet in order to be accepted.

* RBF is an example of mempool **policy**, a set of validation rules applied to unconfirmed
  transactions.

* [PR #22675](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22675) extracts the RBF logic into a
  policy/rbf module and adds documentation. This allows each function to be unit tested and reused
for future projects such as RBF in package validation and Witness Replacement.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What are some benefits of extracting the RBF logic into its own module?

3. Why is the error returned
   [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0ed5ad1023d9ced8cb0930747539c78edd523dc8/src/validation.cpp#L774) a `TxValidationResult::TX_CONSENSUS` instead of
`TxValidationResult::TX_POLICY`, given that this is RBF-related logic?

4. In BIP125 [Rule
   #2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki#implementation-details), why
is it important for the replacement transaction to not introduce any new unconfirmed inputs?

5. The code in [`PaysMoreThanConflicts()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a33fdd0b981965982754b39586eedb7ae456ba57/src/policy/rbf.h#L76) doesn't seem to directly correspond to a rule in BIP125. Why do
we have it, and why don't we merge it with the other fee-related checks in
[`PaysForRBF()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a33fdd0b981965982754b39586eedb7ae456ba57/src/policy/rbf.h#L88)?

6. In BIP125 [Rule
   #4](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki#implementation-details), what
does it mean for a transaction to "pay for its own bandwidth?" Why don't we just allow any
replacement as long as it has a higher feerate?

7. In BIP125 [Rule
   #5](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki#implementation-details), how
is it possible for a transaction to conflict with more than 100 mempool transactions, given that
mempool ancestor and descendant limits don't allow a chain of more than 25 transactions?

8. In
   [`PaysForRBF()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a33fdd0b981965982754b39586eedb7ae456ba57/src/policy/rbf.h#L88),
why is `hash` passed by reference but `original_fees` by value? Should the fee parameters be
`const`? Why or why not?

9. When considering a transaction for submission to the mempool, we check to see if it would cause any
mempool entries to exceed their descendant limits. How do we make sure we don't overestimate by
counting both the new and to-be-replaced transactions, since they would share ancestors?

10. This PR introduces a circular dependency: `policy/rbf -> txmempool -> validation -> policy/rbf`.
This can be avoided by not making policy/rbf depend on txmempool or by using the approach in
[PR #22677](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22677). Which approach do you prefer, and why?
