## Notes

* The way our wallet constructs transactions over time can leak information
  about its contents.  The most obvious example is we can assume that all UTXOs
  sent to the same scriptPubKey are controlled by the same person. UTXOs sent to
  different addresses may also be linked if they are spent together (a common
  heuristic used in chain analysis).  Thus, if we're not careful, observant
  attackers can link addresses to estimate our wallet balance and, if any one of
  our addresses is deanonymized (e.g. we send it to an exchange, merchant, or
  block explorer that knows our personal information or IP address), we might
  accidentally reveal how much money we have!

* The Bitcoin Core wallet implements a few best-practice privacy techniques.
  One is avoiding the reuse of addresses when creating an invoice or change
  address.  Another is grouping UTXOs into
  [OutputGroups](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/4ac1adda9/src/wallet/coinselection.h#L72)
  by scriptPubKey and running coin selection on the groups rather than individual
  UTXOs.

* However, each `OutputGroup` can grow quite large. It might
  not make sense to fund a 0.015 BTC transaction by sweeping a group of 150 inputs
  worth 10 BTC (not to mention the extra fees for all the unnecessary inputs).
  The `OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES` constant limits the number of UTXOs per
  `OutputGroup`.

  - Within `GroupOutputs()`, if we have more than
    `OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES` with the same scriptPubKey, we batch them
    into multiple `OutputGroup`s with up to `OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES` UTXOs each.
    If we are excluding "partial groups," we won't use non-full
    `OutputGroup`s in coin selection.

* [PR#18418](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18418) increases
  `OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES` from 10 to 100. The number 100 was suggested
  during a [previous review club](/17824.html#l-339).
  This behavior change constitutes just one line (and some adjustments to the
  tests), but it is ripe with opportunities to explore how coin selection works.

* Try adding some log statements, re-compiling and then re-running the tests
  (hint: you can use `test/functional/combine_logs.py` to see logs, and you
  assert that your logs are printed by adding `with
  node.assert_debug_log(expected_msg=[your_log_statement])` to the functional
  test).

  - Some good tests to play around with are `wallet_avoidreuse.py` and
    `wallet_groups.py`.
  - The PR author, fjahr, has written an excellent [guide to
    debugging Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/fjahr/debugging_bitcoin) with some
    hints on adding logging and using debuggers.
  - You can also tinker with some of the constants (maybe poke around for
    off-by-one errors) and see if things break!

* You may find some previous review clubs helpful:

  - Review Club [#17824](/17824) discussed the `avoid_reuse` flag.
  - Review Clubs [#17331](/17331) and [#17526](/17526) discussed coin
    selection.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
   What was your review approach?

2. What do the `avoid_reuse` wallet flag and `-avoidpartialspends` wallet
   option do? Why might we want one to automatically turn on the other?

3. If your wallet has 101 UTXOs of 0.01 BTC each, all sent to the same
   scriptPubKey, and tries to send a payment of 0.005 BTC, avoiding partial
   spends, how many inputs will the resulting transaction have (Hint: this is
   almost exactly the `test_full_destination_group_is_preferred` test case in
   wallet\_avoidreuse.py).

4. In that test case, what is the fee amount paid for the 0.5 BTC transaction?
   (Hint: try `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` and call the
   [gettransaction](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/gettransaction.html)
   RPC).

5. Can you have multiple UTXOs under the same address if you set
   `avoid_reuse=true`?

6. What are the advantages, disadvantages, and potential risks to users of
   increasing `OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES`?

7. What do you think of increasing `OUTPUT_GROUP_MAX_ENTRIES` to 100,
   specifically?

8. For the purpose of coin selection, what's the difference between
   [`CoinEligibilityFilter.include_partial_groups`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/4ac1adda/src/wallet/coinselection.h#L65)
   and
   [`CoinSelectionParams.avoid_partial_spends`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/241e1416/src/wallet/wallet.h#L618)?

   (Hint: `m_avoid_partial_spends` becomes `separate_coins` in `GroupOutputs()`)
