## Notes

- Historic blocks that make up the block chain are stored on disk in
  `blk?????.dat` files. Those files each contain multiple serialized blocks,
  which consist of a header followed by the transactions contained in that
  block.

- The [transaction
  index](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/54e31742/src/index/txindex.h#L12-L17)
  is an optional index from transaction id (_txid_) to where that
  transaction is stored in the block files (file and offset), for all
  transactions that have been confirmed in a block. For normal operation of
  the node, a txindex is not required, and by default the txindex is
  disabled.

- The `getrawtransaction` RPC is used to fetch a transaction from the node.
  When the `verbose` argument is set to `false`, it returns the hex-encoded
  serialized transaction. When `verbose` is set to `true`, it returns a JSON
  object containing information about the transaction.

- `getrawtransaction` can retrieve the transaction in one of the following
  ways:

  - *mempool*: unconfirmed transactions can be looked up by txid in the
    mempool.

  - *by block hash*: if the user provides the hash of the block that the
    transaction is contained in, the block (including all transactions) is
    deserialized from disk, and the txid of each of the deserialized
    transactions is compared with the requested txid. If a matching
    transaction is found, it is returned to the user.

  - *using the txindex*: if the node has txindex enabled, then the txid is
    looked up in the transaction index to find the location of the
    transaction on disk. The transaction is then deserialized from that location
    and returned to the user.

- If the user provides the wrong block hash, then the call to
  `getrawtransaction` will fail.

- If txindex is enabled and the correct block hash is provided, then
  [performance will be much slower than if no block hash has been
  provided](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22382). This PR
  attempts to fix that so that there is no performance penalty for providing
  the block hash.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
-->

2. Without looking at the code, why do you think that performance is worse
   when providing a block hash (assuming txindex is enabled)?

3. If we're looking up the transaction by block hash, then what are the
   steps required? How do we know where to find that block on disk? How much
   data is deserialized?

4. If we're looking up the transaction using the txindex, how much data is
   deserialized?

5. The first version of this PR included a [behaviour
   change](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22383#issuecomment-872388955):
   _when an incorrect block_index is provided to GetTransaction, but
   `g_txindex->FindTx(hash, hashBlock, tx)` finds and returns the tx.
   After this PR we would return the tx although it isn't in the block
   the user asked for._

   This behaviour change was removed in a subsequent push to the PR. Do you
   think the behaviour change is an improvement? Should it be included in
   this PR?

6. How can this PR be tested? Are any new test cases required?
