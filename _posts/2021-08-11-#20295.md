## Notes

- Bitcoin Core uses headers-first synchronization (implemented in [PR
  4468](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4468)). It first downloads
  headers from its peers to build a tree of verified headers. Once the headers
  are downloaded and verified, it requests blocks that build towards the
  most-work chain. The decision whether to request a block for download is made
  based on the headers tree.

- This automatic download behavior is beneficial for the normal operation
of a node, saving bandwidth and protecting it against DoS attacks.

- On the other hand, this also restricts the possibilities for analysis of blocks
  that have not been chosen for download. Examples are [stale
  blocks](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/5869/26940) (i.e. blocks that have
  not become part of the best chain).

- This PR introduces a new RPC `getblockfrompeer` that manually attempts to fetch
a block from a peer, while specifying the block hash and the id of the peer.
This is achieved by constructing a GETDATA message for the block and sending it
to the selected peer.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What are the possible applications of the new RPC `getblockfrompeer`?

3. Where in the codebase does a node make the autonomous decision whether to
request a block for download after hearing about it from a peer?
What is the main decision criterion?

4. The [first commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20295/commits/c1f8c221f02c138912c812b3bd3c1eac7462af9a) collects various `Ensure*` helper functions and moves them
to `rpc/server_util.h`. What is the purpose of these functions, and why did this PR move them?

5. What happens if we request a block from a peer, but the peer doesn't have the
block either?

6. This PR requests a block but adds no additional logic for dealing with the
answer to the manual block request. Why is this not necessary?

7. What would happen if we'd use `getblockfrompeer` to request a block for which
our node didn't previously know the header?

8. Can you think of ways to further improve the new RPC command in the future?
(some ideas are mentioned in the PR discussion)
