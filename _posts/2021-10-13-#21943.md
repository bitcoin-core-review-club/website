## Notes

- [CConnman](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92758699/src/net.h#L740)
  is the class in net that opens, maintains and closes connections to peers,
  manages sockets, and reads/writes messages on the network.

- Within `CConnman`, we maintain
  [vNodes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/927586990/src/net.h#L1057),
  a vector of connections to other nodes. That vector is updated and accessed
  by various nodes, including:

  - the [socket handler thread](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/927586990/src/net.cpp#L1617),
    which is responsible for reading data from the sockets into receive
    buffers, and also for accepting new incoming connections.
  - the [open connections thread](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92758699/src/net.cpp#L1820),
    which is responsible for opening new connections to peers on the network.
  - the [message handler thread](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92758699/src/net.cpp#L2225),
    which is responsible for reading messages from the receive buffer and passing them
    up to net_processing.

- Since the vector can be updated by multiple threads, it is guarded by a mutex
  called [cs_vNodes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92758699/src/net.h#L1059).

- For operations that are done on each connection in turn (e.g. reading from each socket in
  the socket handler thread, or passing messages to net_processing in the message handler
  thread), the common pattern is to:

  - lock `cs_vNodes`
  - make a copy of the `vNodes` vector
  - for each `CNode` object, increment an internal
    [nRefCount](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92758699/src/net.h#L454)
    atomic counter.
  - release `cs_vNodes`
  - operate on each of the `CNode` objects in the `vNodes` copy in turn
  - decrement the `nRefCount` counter for each `CNode`

- This PR proposes to extract that pattern into an
  [RAII](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii) object called
  `NodesSnapshot`. It also changes the order of some logic in the socket
  handler thread. The motivation is to reduce [lock
  contentions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1970345/what-is-thread-contention).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. What are the advantages of using RAII?

1. The `CNode` object contains a member called `nRefCount`. This is rather
   similar to the reference counter in a [shared
   pointer](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr). Why do you think
   we use raw pointers to store `CNode` objects in `vNodes` instead of shared pointers?

1. The destructor of the `NodesSnapshot` class calls `Release()` on each `CNode` object
   in turn. It does this without locking the `cs_vNodes` mutex. Is that ok? Why/why not?

1. The socket handler thread contains a [while()
   loop](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92758699/src/net.cpp#L1620-L1625)
   that runs for the entire duration of bitcoind's runtime (`interruptNet` is only
   toggled to false during the shutdown sequence). For that loop not to be 'busy' and
   peg the CPU, there should be a sleep somewhere in the loop. Where is that sleep
   for the socket handler thread?

1. The second commit (_net: don't process newly accepted nodes in
   SocketHandler()_) moves the logic for accepting new connections below where
   the nodes snapshot is taken. What are the consequences of doing that?

1. It has been claimed that this PR reduces lock contention. How would you
   verify or test that?
