## Notes

- [CConnman](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92758699/src/net.h#L740)
  is the class in net that opens, maintains and closes connections to peers,
  manages sockets, and reads/writes messages on the network.

- Within `CConnman`, we maintain
  [vNodes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/927586990/src/net.h#L1057),
  a vector of connections to other nodes. That vector is updated and accessed
  by various nodes, including:

  - the [socket handler thread](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/927586990/src/net.cpp#L1617),
    which is responsible for reading data from the sockets into receive
    buffers, and also for accepting new incoming connections.
  - the [open connections thread](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92758699/src/net.cpp#L1820),
    which is responsible for opening new connections to peers on the network.
  - the [message handler thread](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92758699/src/net.cpp#L2225),
    which is responsible for reading messages from the receive buffer and passing them
    up to net_processing.

- Since the vector can be updated by multiple threads, it is guarded by a mutex
  called [cs_vNodes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92758699/src/net.h#L1059).

- For operations that are done on each connection in turn (e.g. reading from each socket in
  the socket handler thread, or passing messages to net_processing in the message handler
  thread), the common pattern is to:

  - lock `cs_vNodes`
  - make a copy of the `vNodes` vector
  - for each `CNode` object, increment an internal
    [nRefCount](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92758699/src/net.h#L454)
    atomic counter.
  - release `cs_vNodes`
  - operate on each of the `CNode` objects in the `vNodes` copy in turn
  - decrement the `nRefCount` counter for each `CNode`

- This PR proposes to extract that pattern into an
  [RAII](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii) object called
  `NodesSnapshot`. It also changes the order of some logic in the socket
  handler thread. The motivation is to reduce [lock
  contentions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1970345/what-is-thread-contention).
