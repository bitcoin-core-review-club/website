## Notes

### Definitions

- [Undefined Behavior (UB)](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ub):
  there are no restrictions on the behavior of the program if certain rules of
  the language are violated. Examples of undefined behavior are uninitialized
  scalars, memory access outside of array bounds, signed integer overflow, null
  pointer dereference, access to an object through a pointer of a different
  type, etc. Compilers are not required to handle undefined behavior (although
  many simple situations are diagnosed), and the compiled program is not
  required to do anything meaningful.

- **Uninitialized variables** are Undefined Behavior, a typical outcome of which
  is reading stale stack or register values. In the best case, the compiler
  auto-fixes it or it generates an unexpected result. In the worst case, an
  exploit may be created that leaks secrets by allowing use of an
  attacker-controlled value.

- [MemorySanitizer (MSan)](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html)
  ([wiki](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/MemorySanitizer)) is a tool
  that detects uninitialized reads. It consists of a compiler instrumentation
  module and a run-time library. Typical slowdown is 3x and memory usage is
  2x. MSan is supported on Linux/NetBSD/FreeBSD and requires compiling and
  linking all the code in your program, including libraries it uses and the C++
  standard library, with `-fsanitize=memory -fPIE -pie`.

- [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) is a debugging and profiling tool suite to
  make programs faster and more correct. Its most popular tool, Memcheck, can
  detect memory-related errors common in C and C++ programs that can lead to
  crashes and unpredictable behavior. Here is a
  [tutorial](https://www.cprogramming.com/debugging/valgrind.html). Memcheck is
  not perfect: typical slowdown is 3-10x, memory usage is 2x, it can produce
  false positives (there are
  [mechanisms](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core.html#manual-core.suppress)
  for suppressing these; see the
  [valgrind.supp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.19/contrib/valgrind.supp)
  file in Bitcoin Core), and it doesn't currently detect out-of-range reads or
  writes to arrays allocated statically or on the stack.

### Events

- On 10 November 2019, [bitcoinVBR](https://github.com/bitcoinVBR) opened [PR
17433](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17433) "fix
nMinerConfirmationWindow not initialized". The PR was misunderstood as a style
change and closed.

- On 12 November, bitcoinVBR opened a similar change in [PR
17448](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17448) "remove unused variable-
consensus.nMinerConfirmationWindow". Despite a bad merge by the author while
making the PR, the issue had became clear.

- On 14 November, a clean third version was merged, [PR
17449](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17449) "fix uninitialized
variable nMinerConfirmationWindow". It was for this 2-line fix that the Bitcoin
Core [0.19.0.1 patch release](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits/0.19)
was made.

- What was the issue? An uninitialized read in [PR
16713](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16713), merged 27 September 2019,
that got past review by more than a half dozen reviewers (and also [your
host](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16713#pullrequestreview-291029801)
today).

- How did this flaw escape detection?
  - The uninitialized read (of nMinerConfirmationWindow) took place [on mainnet
and testnet but not on
regtest](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17449#issuecomment-552843096).
  - Memory sanitizer [was not
enabled](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17449#issuecomment-552889851)
in the tests and CI.
  - [The compilers were "fixing" our
code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17449#issuecomment-552901592) in
both Clang and GCC with the Bitcoin Core default setting of `-O2`.

- On 30 October, [PR 15921](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15921) -- [a
 review club PR](https://bitcoincore.reviews/15921.html) with quite a few ACKs -- was
 merged which contained another uninitialized read. Bitcoin Core contributor
 [practicalswift](https://github.com/practicalswift) found the issue by
 compiling Bitcoin with `-fsanitize=memory` and with valgrind, which both caught
 the issue. It was fixed in [PR
 17624](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17624).

- On 29 November, practicalswift opened [PR
17633](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17633) to enable running the
functional tests with valgrind memcheck, which was recently merged. Note that
the valgrind `--exit-on-first-error=yes` option is available since version 3.14
on Linux. Valgrind support on macOS may be more limited. [A PR is
open](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17732) to automate setting that
exit flag when running functional tests with valgrind.

- On 30 November, practicalswift opened today's [PR
17639](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17639) to enable running the unit
tests with valgrind memcheck.

### What can we do to mitigate uninitialized variables?

- Recommended reading: the discussion in [PR
  17627](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17627) "Suppress false positive
  warning about uninitialized entropy buffers".

- Test/fuzz/review better... or just write perfect code.
  - We do these things (test, fuzz, and review), but the recent issues show that
    it's not enough.
  - Attackers may find what programmers don't think of, and what fuzzers don't
    hit.

- Compile with `-Werror=uninitialized` or `-Wconditional-uninitialized` and fix
  all uninitialized variables in the codebase.
  - A fair amount of code to change.
  - The value chosen to initialize doesn't necessarily make sense.
  - Code may not express intent anymore.
  - Similarly, static analysis isn't smart enough.

- Use MemorySanitizer or valgrind.
  - MSan requires compiling everything in the process, which is cumbersome.
  - Can't deploy in production.
  - Several times slower and memory-hungry.
  - Resource exhaustion can generate false positives.

- Pre-initialize variables with dummy values, e.g. compile with Clang `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=pattern`.
  - Raises [testing sensitivity
  concerns](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17627#issuecomment-562387426).
  - If a flaw is introduced, it may be undetectable by valgrind.
  - Compilers can warn when they're certain a value will be
    undefined, and pre-emptive dummy initialization breaks those warnings.
  - Valgrind has special macros that can be used to mark memory as undefined. It
    may be best if dummy initialization were to be always done via a macro that
    would allow disabling it for testing, or valgrind annotating it.
