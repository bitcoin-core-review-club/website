## Notes

- [CChainState](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f87e07c6f/src/validation.h#L537-L551)
  represents the node's knowledge of a block chain, with an (optional)
  mempool that is synchronized with that chain. It was introduced in
  [PR 10279](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10279) to eventually be an
  exposed "libconsensus". Initially it was intended to clarify the internal
  interfaces within bitcoind.

- [ChainstateManager](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f87e07c6f/src/validation.h#L827-L854)
  is the class in validation that manages one or more `CChainState` objects. It
  was introduced in [PR 17737](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17737)
  in order to provide unified interface to the multiple chainstates required by
  the [AssumeUTXO](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/assumeutxo/) project. Now
  that a validation instance can contain multiple chainstates, it is eventually
  intended to be the main interface into validation from the rest of the code.

- The `ChainstateManager::ProcessNewBlock()` and
  `ChainstateManager::ProcessNewBlockHeaders()` public functions were added in
  [PR 18698](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18698) as high-level
  interfaces methods to validation. The callers (most notably net_processing) do
  not need to be aware of validation's chainstates (or even whether there are
  multiple chainstates), and simply pass the block or block headers to be
  validated. 

- [AcceptToMemoryPool()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f87e07c6f/src/validation.h#L208-L222)
  (often called _ATMP_) is a free function in the global namespace. Prior to this PR, it was the
  interface through which the rest of the code could call into validation to
  submit a transaction to the mempool. The calling code would need to provide the
  chainstate and mempool as arguments to the function, which breaks the abstraction
  that calling code doesn't need to know about validation's internals.

- This PR adds a new
  [ChainstateManager::ProcessTransaction()](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr23173/src/validation.h#L1005-L1012)
  interface function, similar to `ProcessNewBlock()` and
  `ProcessNewBlockHeaders()`, which provides a high-level interface method for
  submitting transactions to be validated. The caller no longer needs to know
  about the chainstate or mempool inside validation.

- The PR also removes the responsibility of calling the `CTxMemPool::check()`
  consistency check function from the caller (net_processing) and
  [moves it to validation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/f87e07c6f).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. What is `cs_main`?

1. Which components currently call `AcceptToMemoryPool()`? List all the places that we'll call ATMP.

1. What does `CTxMemPool::check()` do? Whose responsibility is it to call that function?

1. What does the `bypass_limits` argument in ATMP do? In which circumstances is ATMP call with `bypass_limits` set to `true`?

1. One of the commit logs reads:

   > "This logic is not necessary for memory pool transactions, as
   > AcceptToMemoryPool already refuses previously-known transaction ids
   > entirely." refers to the logic at
   > https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a206b0ea12eb4606b93323268fc81a4f1f952531/src/main.cpp#L484-L486,
   > which was later removed in commit 450cbb0944cd20a06ce806e6679a1f4c83c50db2.

   What was the change that removed that logic?

1. The last commit is to _Always call mempool.check() after processing a new transaction_. Does that add any overhead to processing/relaying transactions? Why/why not?
