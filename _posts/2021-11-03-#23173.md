- [CChainState](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f87e07c6f/src/validation.h#L537-L551)
  represents the node's knowledge of a block chain, with an (optional)
  mempool that is synchronized with that chain. It was introduced in
  [PR 10279](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10279) to eventually be an
  exposed "libconsensus". Initially it was intended to clarify the internal
  interfaces within bitcoind.

- [ChainstateManager](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f87e07c6f/src/validation.h#L827-L854)
  is the class in validation that manages one or more `CChainState` objects. It
  was introduced in [PR 17737](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17737)
  in order to provide unified interface to the multiple chainstates required by
  the [AssumeUTXO](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/assumeutxo/) project. Now
  that a validation instance can contain multiple chainstates, it is eventually
  intended to be the main interface into validation from the rest of the code.

- The `ChainstateManager::ProcessNewBlock()` and
  `ChainstateManager::ProcessNewBlockHeaders()` public functions were added in
  [PR 18698](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18698) as high-level
  interfaces methods to validation. The callers (most notably net_processing) do
  not need to be aware of validation's chainstates (or even whether there are
  multiple chainstates), and simply pass the block or block headers to be
  validated. 

- [AcceptToMemoryPool()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f87e07c6f/src/validation.h#L208-L222)
  is a free function in the global namespace. Prior to this PR, it was the
  interface through which the rest of the code could call into validation to
  submit a transaction to the mempool. The calling code would need to provide the
  chainstate and mempool as arguments to the function, which breaks the abstraction
  that calling code doesn't need to know about validation's internals.

- This PR adds a new
  [ChainstateManager::ProcessTransaction()](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr23173/src/validation.h#L1005-L1012)
  interface function, similar to `ProcessNewBlock()` and
  `ProcessNewBlockHeaders()`, which provides a high-level interface method for
  submitting transactions to be validated. The caller no longer needs to know
  about the chainstate or mempool inside validation.

- The PR also removes the responsibility of calling the `CTxMemPool::check()`
  consistency check function from the caller (net_processing) and
  [moves it to validation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/f87e07c6f).
