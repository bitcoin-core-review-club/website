## Notes

### Introduction

This week's PR is relatively approachable to review. It is also easy to manually
test by building, launching bitcoind, and running `bitcoin-cli -getinfo` on the
command line, preferably with multiple wallets loaded (you can use the
`createwallet` and `loadwallet` RPCs to do that, if needed).

Yet the PR also brings up several practical topics on Bitcoin Core API process
and design:
- **API removal**. What is the process for deprecating APIs? When should they be
  deprecated, when are they actually deprecated, and when should they be
  removed?
- **Adding APIs**. When should we add an RPC call versus extending an existing one?
- **Multiwallets**. How should we extend the API in the future to handle multiple
  wallets?

### Definitions

- "RPC" is a frequently used acronym for [Remote Procedure
  Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call), a form of
  client–server interaction and request–response protocol.

- The Bitcoin Core RPC API follows the [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/)
  protocol. See the Bitcoin Core
  [JSON-RPC-interface.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md)
  doc for more.

### Context

Today's PR and [PR 18451 "rpc: remove deprecated
getunconfirmedbalance"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18451) were both
motivated by [PR 15930 "rpc: Add balances
RPC"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15930), which added the
`getbalances` RPC and contained a
[commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15930/commits/facfb4111d14a3b06c46690a2cca7ca91cea8a96)
entitled *"rpc: Deprecate getunconfirmedbalance and getwalletinfo balances"*.

### Bitcoin Core deprecation process

#### Soft versus hard deprecation

- Officially, RPC API deprecations in Bitcoin Core now follow the process
  described in
  [JSON-RPC-interface.md#versioning](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md#versioning)
  since [commit
  fa74749](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/fa747498f79c9f6bf29b08f5f3cc01b276126abb)
  ("doc: Clarify RPC versioning") merged in April 2019.

- Nevertheless, Bitcoin Core also has RPCs that contain "DEPRECATED" warnings in
capital letters in the help documentation, but which are not actually
deprecated. Why? Because they have not begun the `-deprecatedrpc` flag
process. I'll refer to these as *soft deprecations*.

- Other RPCs with "DEPRECATED" warnings are in the official deprecation
  process. Let's call them *hard deprecations*.

- Here are two examples of PRs that launch the hard deprecation process:
  - [PR 17578 "rpc: simplify getaddressinfo labels, deprecate previous
behavior"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17578)
  - [PR 17585 "rpc: deprecate getaddressinfo
label"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17585)

#### When to hard deprecate, and when to remove?

- One way of thinking about this might be to distinguish between possibly minor
deprecations, like removing an RPC input argument or result field, and removing
an existing RPC completely.

- Another approach is to think in terms of estimating or verifying current usage
and how much upgrade pain it would ask of users.

### Adding RPCs or extending them

Review is scarce, and one consequence of that is when a particular section of
code is being touched and reviewed, it is often an opportune moment to make --
or be asked to make -- changes touching the same code, while effort and eyes are
on it.

This PR is an illustration of that. It originally began with just one commit to
enable `-getinfo` to call `getbalances`, in order to no longer depend on the
`getwalletinfo` balance response that was soft-deprecated a year earlier.

Then, Bitcoin Core maintainer [laanwj](https://github.com/laanwj) proposed,
while updating this code, [to add displaying the balance per
wallet](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18453#issuecomment-605431806).

- For context, `getinfo` was previously part of the RPC API. It was first marked
as deprecated in v0.14 ([PR 8780](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8780))
and removed in v0.16 ([PR
10838](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10838)), with a deprecation
warning added in that release ([PR
12198](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12198)).

- Now that it has been renamed to `-getinfo` and is no longer part of the RPC
API, `-getinfo` is easier to change and improve without worrying about API
stability, which enables initiatives like [issue
17314](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17314) *"Re-thinking
bitcoin-cli -getinfo."* Displaying the balance for each wallet is point 2 in
that issue list.

This outwardly fun and simple request ended up raising a few unexpected
questions for me. While working on it, it struck me that it might not only be
cleaner to implement by adding a new RPC, but also perhaps more
useful. Ultimately we'll want an RPC that can fetch all the wallet balances in
one call.

The Shakespearean question then became *whether 'tis better to add an RPC or to
extend an existing one,* in the latter case by adding an argument to
`getbalances` to iterate through the loaded wallets.

My initial intuition was that it's (a) more convenient for users to have a
dedicated call, (b) simpler to implement, and (c) faster to run and test,
so I began with that.

### Code

#### Bitcoin CLI and `-getinfo`

Bitcoin CLI calls are in
[`src/bitcoin-cli.cpp`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/bitcoin-cli.cpp). The
`-getinfo` code is in the
[`GetinfoRequestHandler`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/bitcoin-cli.cpp#L224)
class starting at line 224. Under the hood, `-getinfo` performs multiple
requests to various RPC calls, namely to `getnetworkinfo`, `getblockchaininfo`,
and `getwalletinfo`, and presents the results in a (hopefully) user-friendly
output.

#### Wallet RPCs

Many of the wallet RPCs are in
[`src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp),
including the ones we are interested in for this PR. Listed by line number, the
RPCs in that file are:

```code
getnewaddress, getrawchangeaddress, setlabel, sendtoaddress,
listaddressgroupings, signmessage, getreceivedbyaddress, getreceivedbylabel,
getbalance, getunconfirmedbalance, sendmany, addmultisigaddress,
listreceivedbyaddress, listreceivedbylabel, listsinceblock, gettransaction,
abandontransaction, backupwallet, keypoolrefill, walletpassphrase,
walletpassphrasechange, walletlock, encryptwallet, lockunspent, listlockunspent,
settxfee, getbalances, getwalletinfo, listwalletdir, listwallets, loadwallet,
setwalletflag, createwallet, unloadwallet, listunspent, fundrawtransaction,
bumpfee, getaddressesbylabel, listlabels
```

#### Commits

- In the first
[commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18453/commits/ea139c6af3bcda55fa7d50d20c731e71940271d0),
`-getinfo` is changed to replace depending on the soft-deprecated
`getwalletinfo.balance` with using `getbalances.ismine.trusted`.

- In the second
[commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18453/commits/27b81b25ab6c176ba84f69bf9c00fed13c2dca30),
a small RPC, tentatively called `getwalletbalances`, is created to fetch the
`ismine.trusted` balances from all the currently loaded wallets, and functional
test coverage is added. The RPC is undocumented in the help (for now), but it
[can be
called](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18453/commits/27b81b25ab6c176ba84f69bf9c00fed13c2dca30#diff-df7d84ff2f53fcb2a0dc15a3a51e55ceR4289)
from the command line to use and test it.

- The third and final
[commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18453/commits/a5ea5717400d8f31ba210df5705eb6c1470da307)
changes `-getinfo` to call `getwalletbalances` instead of `getbalances` and adds
functional test coverage for the change.


## Questions

1. Did you review the PRs? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, ACK, or
   NACK?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
   (Don't forget to put your PR review on GitHub).

2. Is the `getunconfirmedbalance` RPC deprecated? How about the `getwalletinfo`
   balance fields? Explain.

3. Give an example of a recent Bitcoin Core API deprecation? And removal?

4. *You are the PR author:* how would you implement laanwj's request?

5. How should we extend the Bitcoin Core API to handle multiple wallets? Do you
   prefer extending existing RPCs or adding dedicated ones for this? Which
   calls might be good candidates for updates? What new calls might be needed?
