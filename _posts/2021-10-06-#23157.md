We recently [looked at PR #22677](./22677), which cuts the circular dependency
between validation and txmempool. This week's PR was split off from that PR,
taking a slightly different approach to simplify the `CTxMemPool::check()`
function.

## Notes

- The `CTxMemPool` class is a data structure that stores the set of unconfirmed
  transactions, along with various methods to update or query that set. As well
  as the transactions themselves, the mempool stores metadata about the
  transactions (such as ancestor/descendant dependencies) that makes it highly
  optimized for various operations, such as constructing blocks.

- The mempool must only contain non-conflicting, valid transactions which
  could theoretically be included in the next block. There are therefore
  many [invariants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_invariant) such as:

  - a transaction may only appear in the mempool if all of its inputs are
    either in the UTXO set or are the outputs of other mempool transactions
  - no two transactions in the mempool may spend the same output
  - the {descendant|ancestor} {fees|count|size} cached for the transaction must
    be the correct value

- There are several public methods that can alter the contents of the
  mempool. Those public methods can be called in many different
  circumstances, such as:

  - removing transactions when a block is connected
  - expiring old transactions or evicting transactions by feerate when limiting
    the mempool size
  - replacing transactions for RBF
  - re-inserting transactions from disconnected blocks during a re-org

- Maintaining the mempool's invariants during all of those operations is
  very delicate, and failure to do so can lead to subtle bugs
  such as those fixed in [PR #2876](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2876) or
  [PR #5267](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5267).

- For that reason, [PR #2876](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2876)
  introduced a `CTxMemPool::check()` method, which asserts many of the
  mempool's invariants. Later, [PR
  #5267](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5267) extended those checks.
  The checks are computationally expensive, so the `-checkmempool` command
  line option can control how frequently they're run.  By default, mempool
  checks are always disabled for mainnet, signet and testnet nodes, and always
  enabled for regtest nodes.

- This PR [significantly improves the performance of
  CTxMemPool::check()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23157#issuecomment-932360429),
  and removes a dependency from that function to validation.h.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. Did you run the bench tests before and after the changes to
   `CTxMemPool::check()`? Were your results the same as reported in the PR?

3. Is it important for these checks to be fast? Why/why not?

4. What does the `UpdateCoins()` function do? What is it replaced with in
   this PR?

5. What was `waitingOnDependants` used for before this PR? Explain what
   [this while
loop](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/446b70669/src/txmempool.cpp#L779-L790) was doing. Why can it now be removed?

6. How does the `GetSortedDepthAndScore()` function work? Why does the
   returned vector not contain any descendants before their ancestors?

7. `GetSortedDepthAndScore()` uses the `CTxMemPoolEntry`'s cached ancestor
   count to sort the transactions. What would happen if those cached values
   were incorrect?
