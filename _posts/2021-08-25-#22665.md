## Notes

- Opt-in [Replace By Fee](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/replace-by-fee/) was
  implemented in Bitcoin Core in [PR
  6871](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6871) in 2015. The policy was
  described in a bitcoin-dev [mailing list
  post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-November/011783.html).

- After the implementation was merged, the mailing list description was
  [written up as a BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/261), and merged
  into the BIPs repository as
  [BIP125](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/61ccc849/bip-0125.mediawiki).

- The RBF policy in Bitcoin Core uses the `nSequence` field to signal opt-in for replaceability. According to the BIP:

  > This policy specifies two ways a transaction can signal that it is replaceable.
  >
  > - **Explicit signaling**: A transaction is considered to have opted in to
  >   allowing replacement of itself if any of its inputs have an nSequence
  >   number less than (0xffffffff - 1).
  >
  > - **Inherited signaling**: Transactions that don't explicitly signal
  >   replaceability are replaceable under this policy for as long as any one of
  >   their ancestors signals replaceability and remains unconfirmed.

- It was [recently
  discovered](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/05/12/#cve-2021-31876-discrepancy-between-bip125-and-bitcoin-core-implementation)
  that the Bitcoin Core implementation does _not_ treat the descendants of
  unconfirmed, opt-in RBF-signaling transactions as implicitly signaling
  for replaceability.

- [PR 21946](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21946) added code comments
  to document the discrepancy between BIP125 and the implementation.

- [PR 22665](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22665) replaces the
  `bip125_replaceable` field in the mempool and wallet RPC commands with a
  `replaceable` field. The `bip125_replaceable` field returned whether a
  transaction was replaceable according to the BIP125 rules (including through
  inherited signaling), while the new `replaceable` field returns whether
  the Bitcoin Core mempool considers the transaction replaceable.
