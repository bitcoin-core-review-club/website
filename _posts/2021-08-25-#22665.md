## Notes

- Opt-in [Replace By Fee](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/replace-by-fee/) was
  implemented in Bitcoin Core in [PR
  6871](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6871) in 2015. The policy was
  described in a bitcoin-dev [mailing list
  post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-November/011783.html).

- After the implementation was merged, the mailing list description was
  [written up as a BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/261), and merged
  into the BIPs repository as
  [BIP125](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/61ccc849/bip-0125.mediawiki).

- The RBF policy in Bitcoin Core uses the `nSequence` field to signal opt-in for replaceability. According to the BIP:

  > This policy specifies two ways a transaction can signal that it is replaceable.
  >
  > - **Explicit signaling**: A transaction is considered to have opted in to
  >   allowing replacement of itself if any of its inputs have an nSequence
  >   number less than (0xffffffff - 1).
  >
  > - **Inherited signaling**: Transactions that don't explicitly signal
  >   replaceability are replaceable under this policy for as long as any one of
  >   their ancestors signals replaceability and remains unconfirmed.

- It was [recently
  discovered](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/05/12/#cve-2021-31876-discrepancy-between-bip125-and-bitcoin-core-implementation)
  that the Bitcoin Core implementation does _not_ treat the descendants of
  unconfirmed, opt-in RBF-signaling transactions as implicitly signaling
  for replaceability.

- [PR 21946](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21946) added code comments
  to document the discrepancy between BIP125 and the implementation.

- [PR 22665](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22665) replaces the
  `bip125_replaceable` field in the mempool and wallet RPC commands with a
  `replaceable` field. The `bip125_replaceable` field returned whether a
  transaction was replaceable according to the BIP125 rules (including through
  inherited signaling), while the new `replaceable` field returns whether
  the Bitcoin Core mempool considers the transaction replaceable.

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. There's an [alternative PR
   22698](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22698) which implements the
   inherited signaling as documented in BIP125. Which of the two approaches do you
   prefer? Why?

1. Prior to this PR, there was a `Chain` interface member function
   [`isRBFOptIn()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f6f7a124/src/node/interfaces.cpp#L548).
   This PR changes the caller to use `SignalsOptInRBF()` instead. Why is
   `SignalsOptInRBF()` a free function and not a member of the `Chain`
   interface class?

1. Before this PR, the `bip125-replaceable` field could be `yes`, `no`, or
   `unknown`. The new `replaceable` field can only be `true` or `false`. Why is
   it never set to `unknown`?

1. What is the `IsDeprecatedRPCEnabled()` function used for? Why does this
   PR move that function from `rpc/server` to `rpc/util`? Describe the process
   for deprecating RPC methods and fields. Why do we deprecate in this way?

1. Do you agree that we should use a deprecation process to change the name
   from `bip125-replaceable` to `replaceable`? Why don't we just update the
   value that is returned in `bip125-replaceable`?
