## Notes

### Background

[StratumV2 (Sv2)](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/tree/main) protocol defines various roles, one of which is the Template Provider (TP), explained in the [template distribution](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/07-Template-Distribution-Protocol.md) section of the spec. The TP pushes block template updates to miners whenever the chain tip is updated or when mempool fees have increased sufficiently.

Rather than implementing the TP role in Bitcoin Core, the work done in [#31098](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31098) allows third-party processes to interface with bitcoind through interprocess communication (IPC). The IPC interface, introduced as part of the [multiprocess](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28722) project, is work-in-progress too.

Bitcoin Core now exposes a mining interface through two classes `BlockTemplate` and `Mining` which provide key methods needed by the [Sv2 TP client](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/07-Template-Distribution-Protocol.md), enabling projects like [Sjors' TP client](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/tree/mining-interfaces) to receive block template updates via the interface.

### PR Overview
- PR [#31981](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31981) adds a new method to the mining interface called `checkBlock` that checks the validity of a block template. This check is equivalent to the one done in [`getblocktemplate` RPC in proposal mode](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9efe5466885862bc1fb830524f7ce23e785fcac0/src/rpc/mining.cpp#L724-L750). 

- The method responsible for checking whether a block template is valid in Bitcoin core is [`TestBlockValidity`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9efe5466885862bc1fb830524f7ce23e785fcac0/src/validation.h#L387).

### Motivation

- Using the IPC interface to check block validity is more performant than the `getblocktemplate` RPC, as it avoids serializing up to 4 MB of transaction data as JSON.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

2. Does an Sv2 TP client have to implement the new `checkBlock` method in the mining interface (yes/no)?

3. Can you list some checks performed on the block in `getblocktemplate` proposal mode? Does that include checking for a valid proof of work for the block template?

4. Apart from performance reasons mentioned in the PR description, are there any reasons an Sv2 TP client would want to use IPC instead of RPC?

5. What is the key difference between contextual and context-free checks in the block template validity checks?

6. Is there a change in behavior for `TestBlockValidity` after this PR, or is it a pure refactor? If yes, what's the change?

7. One of the reasons for locking `cs_main` in `TestBlockValidity` is to prevent `CheckBlock` race conditions. Can you describe a scenario when that might happen?

8. In [commit 1d029c23](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/1d029c23a143f1b9110377967a7c4a20ee75058d/src/validation.cpp#L4662), why do we assert that `fChecked` should return false? Is this a potential issue?

9. In this [`CheckBlock`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9efe5466885862bc1fb830524f7ce23e785fcac0/src/validation.cpp#L4078) size check, which size rule are we checking? Is it an overestimate check? Which size check is missing there?

10. In [commit cca5993b](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/cca5993b26e6223af31fe1ef5bf8a319cb87cf93), can you clarify the note that serialization of `BlockValidationState` is "fragile"?
