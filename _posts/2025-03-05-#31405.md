## Notes

- The [`BlockManager::m_block_index`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3c1f72a36700271c7c1293383549c3be29f28edb/src/node/blockstorage.h#L277) is a map which is used to keep track of which block headers exist, how they interconnect, and where on disk the block data (if any) is stored [^1]. Generally speaking, it is updated whenever a new valid header with sufficient Proof-of-Work (PoW) is received. It contains entries for blocks in the current most-PoW chain, alternative chains, and even invalid blocks.

- The `CBlockIndex` objects in this map can be considered the nodes in a tree shaped structure with the genesis block at its root. By definition, each block can only point to a [single predecessor](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3c1f72a36700271c7c1293383549c3be29f28edb/src/chain.h#L147), but multiple blocks can point to the same predecessor. Of course, in a single chain, this tree is pruned so that each block will never have more than one block pointing to it. The entire tree structure is kept to enable efficiently handling chain reorgs.

- Block validation is a process that consists of multiple steps, gradually bumping up the `CBlockIndex`'s `nStatus` from its default-initialized `BLOCK_VALID_UNKNOWN` to `BLOCK_VALID_SCRIPTS`. The validation flow which is relevant to this PR can be summarised as:
	- When the header is successfully validated with `AcceptBlockHeader()`, it is added to `m_block_index`, and generally never removed from it anymore, even if the block fails a subsequent validation step.
	- When the partial block validation in `AcceptBlock()` succeeds, the block is persisted to disk. This validation is partial, because full validation requires the predecessor block's data, which the node may not have received yet.
	- As soon as a block header becomes eligible to be part of the fully validated current chain (i.e. it is part of the most-PoW chain, and all data for the block's predecessors is available), `ActivateBestChain()` will attempt to connect the block. If this final validation step succeeds, the block is connected and its `nStatus` is [raised](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3c1f72a36700271c7c1293383549c3be29f28edb/src/validation.cpp#L2762) to the ultimate `BLOCK_VALID_SCRIPTS`.

- `CBlockIndex` holds a `pprev` pointer to its predecessor which makes it trivial to iterate backwards (towards the genesis block) over the block tree. Iterating forwards (towards the chain tip) is not possible, because a block can have multiple successors pointing to it. The lack of forward iteration makes operations such as finding a new best block header expensive, because we have to iterate over the entire `m_block_index` block tree again.

- `ChainstateManager::m_best_header` and `ActiveChain.Tip()` are both `CBlockIndex` pointers. During normal operation, they'll often converge to the same block with the highest PoW. However, it is crucial to distinguish their meaning and use. `ActiveChain.Tip()` returns the `CBlockIndex*` of the fully validated and connected block that is the tip of the currently active chain. `m_best_header` points to the header with the most PoW that the node knows about. It represents a node's view of what the most-PoW chain might look like, but it is possible that validation won't allow it to progress there. As such, `m_best_header` is just a hint. The distinction is especially visible during IBD, when `ActiveChain().Tip()` progresses towards `m_best_header`, but can only be equal to it when IBD is finished.


## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

1. Which purpose(s) does `ChainstateManager::m_best_header` serve?

1. Prior to this PR, which of these statements are true, if any?
	- A) a `CBlockIndex` with an INVALID predecessor will ALWAYS have a `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD` `nStatus`
	- B) a `CBlockIndex` with only VALID predecessors will NEVER have a `BLOCK_FAILED_CHILD` `nStatus`

1. One of the goals of this PR is to ensure `m_best_header`, and the `nStatus` of successors of an invalid block are always correctly set. Which functions are directly responsible for updating these values?

1. For which scenario(s), if any, does commit [validation: call InvalidChainfound also from AcceptBlock](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/163b01eae82a9dd94dcda94cf13001e46b4a8a56) introduce behaviour change?

1. Most of the logic in commit [validation: in invalidateblock, calculate m_best_header right away](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/4100495125e9a06b2403f7520fae9f45c3fd9e4c) implements finding the new best header. What prevents us from just using `RecalculateBestHeader()` here? 

1. How many times does `Chainstate::InvalidBlock()` trigger the `m_best_header` recalculation, 1) before this PR and 2) after this PR?

1. In [validation: in invalidateblock, mark children as invalid right away](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/e32df45a62e6999b12d035758c9c6bd4994ea682)`cand_invalid_descendants` is implemented as a `std::multimap<const CBlockIndex*, CBlockIndex*>`. Can you think of any other type(s) that would work well in this context?

1. Would we still need the  `cand_invalid_descendants` cache if we were able to iterate forwards (i.e. away from the genesis block) over the block tree? What would be the pros and cons of such an approach, compared to the one taken in this PR?
