## Notes

### Motivation

While doing initial block download (IBD) over a fluctuating and slow internet
connection in El Salvador, I observed very frequent peer disconnections in the
debug log, on the order of 100+ per hour. These disconnections were often of
manually added "addnode" peers, and logged as `Peer is stalling block download,
disconnecting <peer>`. Ping requests to these peers often took 20-100 seconds.

Even after IBD was completed, addnode peer disconnections still happened:

`Timeout downloading block <hex>, disconnecting <peer>`

### Discussion

When an addnode peer is disconnected by the IBD headers/blocks download timeout
or stalling logic, `ThreadOpenAddedConnections` attempts to immediately
reconnect it -- unless "onetry" was passed to the addnode RPC -- up to the limit
of 8 addnode connections. This limit is separate from the regular peer
connection limits.

`ThreadOpenAddedConnections` will continue to attempt reconnection of the
disconnected addnode peer until it succeeds.

When these disconnection/reconnection cycles happen frequently with
addnode peers, it is likely network, resource and time intensive.
This is particularly true for I2P peers, as these involve destroying and
rebuilding 2 tunnels for each peer connection. It seems worth avoiding this if
it is straightforward to do so.

Automatic (non-addnode) peers are also disconnected by the same logic, but they
are a different category and case (non-protected peers, no immediate
connection/reconnection) that would require monitoring over time to adjust the
timeouts accordingly. Martin Zumsande was looking into optimizing this (see
https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2025-01-22#1083993): *"The
challenge is to distinguish this situation from making things worse for
fast/reliable connections that just have some slow peers which should be
disconnected."*

The goal of this pull request is thus to avoid unnecessary frequent
disconnections and immediate reconnections of addnode peers, both during IBD and
afterwards.

### Approach

1. The first commit, "p2p: protect addnode peers during IBD", provides addnode
   peers the max `BLOCK_STALLING_TIMEOUT_MAX` value of 64 seconds for the IBD
   stalling logic ("Peer is stalling block download") in `src/net_processing.cpp`.

2. The second commit, "p2p: don't disconnect addnode peers for block download
   timeout", proposes to protect addnode peers from disconnection. [Review
   feedback](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32051#pullrequestreview-2691505746)
   suggested that we also clear their block requests, so that these blocks can
   be requested from other peers.

3. The third commit, "p2p: don't disconnect addnode peers for slow
   initial-headers-sync", proposes the same protection for addnode peers that we
   currently already provide to peers with `NetPermissionFlags::NoBan`
   permission.

4. The fourth commit, "rpc, doc: update addnode documentation", updates the RPC
   addnode help documentation.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

2. What is an addnode peer? How can you specify them to your node?

3. Do you provide addnode peers to the node(s) that you run? Why or why not?
   What kind of peers do you choose?

4. What is a fundamental protection that addnode peers can provide to your node?

5. It appears the issue mostly, but not exclusively, arises during IBD.
   Which code is responsible for that discrepancy?

6. What do you think of the [review suggestion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32051#issuecomment-2825824998)
   to rate peers and use that to scale the number of blocks we request from them?

7. One reviewer
   [suggested](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32051#pullrequestreview-2691505746)
   clearing bock requests instead of disconnecting peers. How would you
   implement this?

8. How is the test coverage for the code affected by this change? Can
   you think of any tests that would be worthwhile adding?
